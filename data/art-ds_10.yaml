    results throughout the book. However, it deserves its own chapter because there
    is much more to interpretation than matching expectations to results and because
    it is, in and of itself, a major step of data analysis. Because interpretation
    happens most deliberately after completing your primary and supportive analyses,

    performing the step, and then see if the result of the step matches your expectations.
    Your expectations are based on what you learned in the process of your exploratory
    data analysis and formal modeling, and when your interpretation doesn’t match
    your expectations, then you will need to determine whether they don’t match because
    your expectations are incorrect or your interpretation is incorrect. Even though
    you may be on one of the last steps of data analysis when you are formally interpreting
    your results, you may need to go back to exploratory data analysis or modeling

    your interpretation. For example, your original question may have been, “For every

    original intent was to determine how much greater the BMI is among adults in the
    US who drink, for example, two 12-ounce cans of sodas per day on average, than
    among adults who drink only one 12-ounce soda per day on average. The interpretation
    of your analyses should yield a statement such as: For every 1 additional 12-ounce
    can of soda that adults in the US drink, BMI increases, on average, by X kg/m².

    kg/m²。但不应该得出这样的陈述：“每喝一盎司额外的汽水，美国成年人的BMI平均增加X kg/m²。”
- en: Another way in which revisiting your question provides a framework for interpreting
    your results is that reminding yourself of the type of question that you asked
    provides an explicit framework for interpretation (See [Stating and Refining the
    Question](chap02.xhtml#chapter-question) for a review of types of questions).
    For example, if your question was, “Among adults in the US, do those who drink
    1 more 12-ounce serving of non-diet soda per day have a higher BMI, on average?”,
    this tells you that your question is an *inferential* question and that your goal
    is to understand the average effect of drinking an additional 12-ounce serving
    of non-diet soda per day on BMI among the US adult population. To answer this
    question, you may have performed an analysis using cross-sectional data collected
    on a sample that was representative of the US adult population, and in this case
    your interpretation of the result is framed in terms of what the association is
    between an additional 12-ounce serving of soda per day and BMI, on average in
    the US adult population.

  zh: 重新审视你的问题提供了解释结果的框架的另一种方式是，提醒自己你所问问题的类型为解释提供了明确的框架（参见[陈述和细化问题](chap02.xhtml#chapter-question)以回顾问题的类型）。例如，如果你的问题是：“在美国成年人中，每天多喝一听非减肥汽水的人，平均BMI更高吗？”，这告诉你你的问题是一个*推断性*问题，并且你的目标是了解在美国成年人群中，每天多喝一听非减肥汽水对BMI的平均影响。为了回答这个问题，你可能已经使用了代表美国成年人群体的横断面数据进行了分析，在这种情况下，你对结果的解释是以每天多喝一听汽水对美国成年人群体的BMI的平均影响来表述的。
- en: 'Because your question was not a causal one, and therefore your analysis was
    not a causal analysis, the result cannot be framed in terms of what would happen
    if a population started consuming an additional can of soda per day. A *causal*
    question might be: “What effect does drinking an additional 12-ounce serving of
    non-diet soda per day have on BMI?”, and to answer this question, you might analyze
    data from a clinical trial that randomly assigned one group to drink an additional
    can of soda and the other group to drink an additional can of a placebo drink.
    The results from this type of question and analysis could be interpreted as what
    the causal effect of drinking additional 12-ounce can of soda per day would be
    on BMI. Because the analysis is comparing the average effect on BMI between the
    two groups (soda and placebo), the result would be interpreted as the average
    causal effect in the population.'

- en: A third purpose of revisiting your original question is that it is important
    to pause and consider whether your approach to answering the question could have
    produced a **biased** result. Although we covered bias to some degree in the chapter
    on [Stating and Refining the Question](chap02.xhtml#chapter-question), sometimes
    new information is acquired during the process of exploratory data analysis and/or
    modeling that directly affects your assessment of whether your result might be

- en: We will use the soda-BMI example to illustrate a simpler example of bias. Let’s
    assume that your overall question about the soda-BMI relationship had included
    an initial question, which was, “What is the mean daily non-diet soda consumption
    among adults in the US?” Let’s assume that your analysis indicates that in the
    sample you are analyzing, which is a sample of all adults in the US, the average
    number of 12-ounce servings of non-diet soda drunk per day is 0.5, so you infer
    that the average number of 12-ounce servings of soda drunk per day by adults in
    the US is also 0.5\. Since you should always challenge your results, it is important

- en: So how do you do this? You start by imagining that your result is incorrect,
    and then think through the ways in which the data collection or analysis could
    have had a systematic problem that resulted in an incorrect estimate of the mean
    number of 12-ounce cans of non-diet soda drunk per day by adults in the US. Although
    this exercise of imagining that your result is wrong is discussed as an approach
    to assessing the potential for bias, this is a terrific way to **challenge your

    or confounding, or a technical problem with your analysis.

    0.5, might be so far off from the true result: for some reason, the sample of
    the population that comprises your dataset is not a random sample of the population
    and instead has a disproportionate number of people who do not drink any non-diet
    soda, which brings down the estimated mean number of 12 ounces of servings of
    non-diet soda consumed per day. You might also imagine that if your sample result
    had been 4, which is much higher than the true amount drunk per day by adults
    in the US, that your sample has a disproportionate number of people who have high

- en: To figure out if your sample is a non-random sample of the target population,
    think about what could have happened to attract more people who don’t consume
    non-diet soda (or more people who consume a lot of it) to be included in the sample.
    Perhaps the study advertised for participation in a fitness magazine, and fitness
    magazine readers are less likely to drink non-diet soda. Or perhaps the data were
    collected by an internet survey and internet survey respondents are less likely
    to drink non-diet soda. Or perhaps the survey captured information about non-diet
    soda consumption by providing a list of non-diet sodas and asking survey respondents
    to indicate which ones they had consumed, but the survey omitted Mountain Dew
    and Cherry Coke, so that those people who drink mostly these non-diet sodas were

    Dew和Cherry Coke，因此那些主要喝这些非无糖汽水的人被归类为不喝非无糖汽水（或者比他们实际消费的更少）。等等。
- en: Although we illustrated the simplest scenario for bias, which occurs when estimating
    a prevalence or a mean, you of course can get a biased result for an estimate
    of a relationship between two variables as well. For example, the survey methods
    could unintentionally oversample people who both don’t consume non-diet soda and
    have a high BMI (such as people with type 2 diabetes), so that the result would
    indicate (incorrectly) that consuming non-diet soda is not associated with having
    a higher BMI. The point is that pausing to perform a deliberate thought experiment
    about sources of bias is critically important as it is really the only way to
    assess the potential for a biased result. This thought experiment should also

    “soda” variable. If the units are 12-ounce cans of soda per day, then the interpretation
    of this slope is that BMI increases by 0.28 kg/m² per additional 12-ounce can

    kg/m²，每天消费一罐额外的非饮食苏打。然而，单位是盎司的苏打水，所以你模型的解释是，BMI每增加0.28 kg/m²，每天额外消耗一盎司的非饮食苏打。

    non-diet soda. So you’ll need to convert the 0.28 slope so that it pertains to
    a 12-ounce, rather than 1 ounce, increase in soda consumption. Because the model
    is a linear model, you can simply multiply the slope, or beta coefficient, by

- en: Another important consideration about the magnitude of the relationship is whether
    it is meaningful. For example, a 0.01 increase in BMI for every additional 20
    ounces consumed per day is probably not particularly meaningful as a large amount
    of soda is associated with a very small increase in BMI. On the other hand, if
    there were a 0.28 kg/m² increase in BMI for every 1 ounce increase in soda consumption,
    this would in fact be quite meaningful. Because you know BMI generally ranges
    from the high teens to the 30’s, a change of 0.01 kg/m² is small, but a change
    of 0.28 kg/m² could be meaningful.

  zh: 关于关系幅度的另一个重要考虑因素是它是否有意义。例如，每天额外消耗20盎司，BMI增加0.01可能不是特别有意义，因为大量的苏打与BMI的增加关系很小。另一方面，如果每增加1盎司的苏打水，BMI增加0.28
    kg/m²，那么这实际上是相当有意义的。因为你知道BMI通常在高十几到30岁之间变化，0.01 kg/m²的变化很小，但0.28 kg/m²的变化可能是有意义的。
- en: When taken in the context of the kinds of volumes of soda people might consume,
    a 0.01 kg/m² for each 20 ounce increase in soda consumption is small since people
    are (hopefully) not drinking 10 twenty ounce servings per day, which is how much
    someone would need to drink in order to observe even a 0.1 kg/m² increase in BMI.
    On the other hand a 0.28 kg/m² increase in BMI for every additional ounce of soda
    would add up quickly for people who consumed an extra 20 ounce non-diet soda per
    day - this would equate to an expected increase in BMI of 5.6 kg/m². A key part
    of interpreting the magnitude of the result, then, is understanding how the magnitude
    of the result compares to what you know about this type of information in the
    population you’re interested in.

    kg/m² BMI增加。另一方面，每增加一盎司苏打水摄入量0.28 kg/m² 的BMI增加会对每天额外摄入20盎司非饮食苏打水的人迅速累积起来 - 这将等同于BMI增加5.6

- en: Another tool for measuring uncertainty is, of course, the p-value, which simply
    is the probability of getting the sample result of 0.28 kg/m² (or more extreme)
    when the true relationship between non-diet soda consumption and BMI in the overall
    population is 0\. Although the p-value is a continuous measure of uncertainty,
    many people consider a p-value of <0.05, which indicates that there is a less
    than 5% probability of observing the sample result (or a more extreme result)
    when there is no relationship in the overall population, as “statistically significant”.
    This cutpoint is arbitrary and tells us very little about the *degree* of uncertainty
    or about where the true answer for the overall population lies. Focusing primarily

    consumption and BMI in the adult US population lies somewhere between a 0.15 and

    is consumed. Using this latter approach tells us something about the range of
    possible effects of soda on BMI and also tells us that it is very unlikely that
    soda has no association with BMI in the overall population of adults in the US.
    Using the p-value as the measure of uncertainty, on the other hand, implies that
    we have only two choices in terms of interpreting the result: either there is
    a good amount of uncertainty about it so we must conclude that there is no relationship
    between soda consumption and BMI, or there is very little uncertainty about the
    result so we must conclude that there is a relationship between soda consumption

    kg/m²之间。使用后一种方法告诉我们一些关于苏打饮料对BMI可能效应范围的信息，并告诉我们，在美国成年人口中，苏打饮料与BMI没有关联的可能性非常小。另一方面，使用p值作为不确定性的度量意味着我们在解释结果方面只有两种选择：要么对结果存在很大的不确定性，因此我们必须得出结论认为苏打饮料消费与BMI之间没有关系，要么对结果的不确定性很小，因此我们必须得出结论认为苏打饮料消费与BMI之间存在关系。使用p值会限制我们，这并不反映权衡支持（或反对）假设证据强度的过程。

    includes income because you realize that it is possible that the relationship
    you observe in your primary model could be explained entirely by socioeconomic
    status: people of higher socioeconomic status might drink less non-diet soda and
    also have lower BMIs, but it is not because they drink less soda that this is
    the case. Instead, it is some other factor associated with socioeconomic status
    that has the effect on BMI. So you can run a secondary model in which income is

    the implications are straightforward, but other times the implications take some
    thought. An example of a straightforward implication is if you performed an analysis
    to determine if purchasing ads increased sales, and if so, did the investment
    in ads result in a net profit. You may learn that either there was a net profit
    or not, and if there were a net profit, this finding would support continuing
    the ads.

  zh: 现在，你已经解释了你的结果并得出了结论，你会想到你的结论的含义。毕竟，进行分析的目的通常是为了提供决策或采取行动。有时，影响很直接，但有时需要一些思考。一个明显的影响的例子是，如果你进行了分析以确定购买广告是否增加了销售额，如果是这样，广告投资是否带来了净利润。你可能会得知是否有净利润，如果有净利润，这一发现将支持继续投放广告。
- en: A more complicated example is the soda-BMI example we’ve used throughout this
    chapter. If soda consumption turned out to be associated with higher BMI, with
    a 20 ounce additional serving per day associated with a 0.28 kg/m² greater BMI,
    this finding would imply that if you could reduce soda consumption, you could
    reduce the average BMI of the overall population. Since your analysis wasn’t a
    causal one, though, and you only demonstrated an association, you may want to
    perform a study in which you randomly assign people to either replacing one of
    the 20 ounce sodas they drink each day with diet soda or to not replacing their
    non-diet soda. In a public health setting, though, your team may decide that this
    association is sufficient evidence to launch a public health campaign to reduce
    soda consumption, and that you do not need additional data from a clinical trial.
    Instead, you may plan to track the population’s BMI during and after the public
    health campaign as a means of estimating the public health effect of reducing
    non-diet soda consumption. The take-home point here is that the action that results
    from the implications often depends on the mission of the organization that requested
    the analysis.

  zh: 一个更复杂的例子是本章节中我们一直在使用的苏打-身体质量指数（BMI）的例子。如果苏打饮用量与更高的BMI相关联，每天额外摄入 20 盎司与BMI增加0.28
    kg/m²，那么这一发现意味着如果你能减少苏打饮用量，就能降低整体人口的平均BMI。但由于你的分析并不是因果关系分析，你只是展示了一种关联，你可能想进行一项研究，随机将人们分配到要么用含有代糖的苏打替换每天喝的一罐
    20 盎司苏打，要么继续喝非代糖苏打。在公共卫生领域，你的团队可能决定这种关联已经足够成立，启动一项减少苏打饮用量的公共卫生活动，并且你不需要来自临床试验的额外数据。相反，你可能计划在公共卫生活动期间和之后跟踪人口的BMI，作为估算减少非代糖苏打饮用对公共卫生的影响的一种方法。这里的要点是，由此带来的行动往往取决于请求分析的组织的任务。
