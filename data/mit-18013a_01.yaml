  zh: 前言
- en: The course 18.013A as it appears here is intended as a one and a half term course
    in calculus for students who have studied calculus in high school. It is intended
    to be self contained, so that it is possible to follow it without any background
    in calculus, for the adventurous.

  zh: 这里呈现的18.013A课程旨在为在高中学习过微积分的学生提供一个一个半学期的微积分课程。它旨在是自包含的，因此可以在没有任何微积分背景的情况下跟随，对于那些冒险的人来说是可能的。
- en: It makes use of some tools that are relatively new, such as applets, which are
    intended to make the subject easier to learn and more fun.

  zh: 它利用了一些相对较新的工具，比如小程序，旨在使学科更易学习和更有趣。
- en: However it was not our intention to make this course merely an easy calculus
    course, covering all the same material as the traditional course, but easier to
    assimilate because of the applets and use of spreadsheets.

  zh: 然而，我们并不打算让这门课程仅仅成为一个简单的微积分课程，覆盖与传统课程相同的所有内容，但由于小程序和电子表格的使用，更容易吸收。
- en: Modern labor saving devices in practice do not make life easier and simpler.
    Instead they save us time that allows us to do more in our lives and to make life
    more complicated and busier than ever.

  zh: 实际上，现代节省劳动力的设备并没有使生活更轻松简单。相反，它们节省了我们时间，使我们能够在生活中做更多事情，使生活变得比以往更加复杂和繁忙。
- en: In the same sense it is our hope that these new tools allow the student to learn
    more and learn more thoroughly with the same amount of, and even perhaps more,
    effort than before.
  id: totrans-5

  zh: 同样，我们希望这些新工具能让学生在同样甚至更多的努力下学到更多、更彻底地学到更多。
- en: Thus, the material covered is substantially greater in depth and variety than
    is normally attempted in a calculus course.
  id: totrans-6

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 因此，所涵盖的材料在深度和多样性上远远超出了通常在微积分课程中尝试的范围。
- en: In fact, we have attempted to inject new material into almost every chapter
    of the text as it appears on this site.
  id: totrans-7

  zh: 实际上，我们试图在这个网站上的每一章几乎都注入了新的材料。

  zh: 为什么我们这样做呢？
- en: 'In part it is mere human frailty: to keep from going crazy while creating this
    material.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 部分原因是人类的脆弱性：为了在创作这些材料时不至于发疯。
- en: Also, though, it is in order to maintain interest in the subject among those
    who have already been exposed to it. Finally, it is to show how easy it now is
    to absorb and use material that not long ago was utterly inaccessible to students,
    rarely taught, and when taught rarely mastered.
  id: totrans-10

  zh: 此外，也是为了保持对已经接触过该主题的人的兴趣。最后，是为了展示现在吸收和使用不久前对学生完全无法接触、很少教授，甚至在教授时很少掌握的材料是多么容易。
- en: Obviously some of the extra material contributes mainly to confuse students,
    some is very badly done though it could be improved, some might suggest to you
    even better things that might be included.

  zh: 显然，一些额外材料主要是为了让学生感到困惑，有些做得很糟糕，尽管可以改进，有些可能会给你提出更好的建议，可以包含在其中。
- en: The authors would be delighted if you find a way to use this material or to
    learn from it. We would be extremely grateful if you would send us via email ([djk@math.mit.edu](mailto:djk@math.mit.edu))
    any comments you have about it, especially from those who don't like something
    they see.

  zh: 作者们会很高兴如果你找到一种使用这些材料或从中学习的方法。如果您能通过电子邮件（[djk@math.mit.edu](mailto:djk@math.mit.edu)）向我们发送您对此的任何评论，尤其是那些不喜欢看到的人，我们将不胜感激。

  zh: 那么在这里对微积分课程有什么新的内容呢？
- en: Chapter 0 which introduces the spreadsheet is entirely new.

  zh: 引入电子表格的第0章是全新的。
- en: The discussion of standard functions in Chapter 1 is new.

  zh: 第1章中对标准函数的讨论是新的。
- en: The geometric definitions of the trigonometric functions by the illustration
    is new in Chapter 2, and the section on various metrics (3.8) is new in Chapter
    3\. (It probably does more harm than good there.)
  id: totrans-17

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 通过插图在第2章中对三角函数进行几何定义是新的，第3章中关于各种度量标准（3.8）的部分是新的。（在那里可能带来更多的伤害而不是好处。）
- en: The main innovations in Chapters 4 and 5 are the applets, though introduction
    of the concepts of eigenvectors and eigenvalues at this stage is perhaps unusual.
  id: totrans-18

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 第4章和第5章的主要创新是小程序，尽管在这个阶段引入特征向量和特征值的概念可能有些不同寻常。
- en: Chapter 6, which involves definition of differentiation in all dimensions is
    novel; but I think it helps make it possible for students to see why the rules
    of differentiation are what they are, and why calculus is useful.
  id: totrans-19

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 第6章涉及在所有维度中定义微分的内容是新颖的；但我认为这有助于让学生看到为什么微分规则是什么样的，以及微积分为何有用。
- en: Chapter 7 on numerical differentiation is new at least to me.
  id: totrans-20

  zh: 第7章关于数值微分对我来说是新的。
- en: There is not much new in Chapter 8 except for it applying in all dimensions.
  id: totrans-21
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 第8章没有太多新内容，除了它适用于所有维度。
- en: Probably the major innovations in this course apart from the applets, are the
    sections on numerical analysis, the study of single and multiple variable calculus
    together, introduction of integration in the complex plane, and the applications
    to physics, which while commonplace in physics, rarely are discussed in a calculus
    course.
  id: totrans-22
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 除了小程序之外，这门课程的主要创新可能是数值分析部分，单变量和多变量微积分的研究，复平面中积分的引入以及与物理学的应用。尽管这些在物理学中很常见，但在微积分课程中很少讨论。
- en: Our intent here is to cover enough about more advanced areas of mathematics
    to make students aware of them and to encourage their wanting to learn more about
    them.
  id: totrans-23
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 我们的目的是涵盖足够多关于数学更高级领域的内容，让学生们意识到它们的存在，并激励他们想要进一步学习这些内容。
- en: This material could conceivably be studied by a student on his or her own, but
    this seldom works out. Students tend to get stuck on something, and, having no
    goad to keep them going, they try to get past it with decreasing energy, and ultimately
    develop mental blocks against going on. Having an organized course prevents this
    by forcing them to face obstacles like exams and assignments.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 这些材料理论上可以由学生自学，但这很少会成功。学生往往会在某些地方卡住，由于没有目标来推动他们继续前进，他们会试图以逐渐减少的精力克服困难，最终对继续学习产生心理障碍。有组织的课程通过强迫他们面对考试和作业等障碍来防止这种情况的发生。
- en: If you attempt this and get stuck, as is almost inevitable, you could try emailing
    us and we can try to unstick you.
