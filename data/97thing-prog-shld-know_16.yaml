- en: In my first programming class in college, my teacher handed out two BASIC coding
    sheets. On the board, the assignment read "Write a program to input and average
    10 bowling scores." Then the teacher left the room. How hard could this be? I
    don't remember my final solution but I'm sure it had a `FOR/NEXT` loop in it and
    couldn't have been more than 15 lines long in total. Coding sheets — for you kids
    reading this, yes, we used to write code out longhand before actually entering
    it into a computer — allowed for around 70 lines of code each. I was very confused
    as to why the teacher would have given us two sheets. Since my handwriting has
    always been atrocious, I used the second one to recopy my code very neatly, hoping
    to get a couple extra points for style.

  zh: 在我大学的第一门编程课上，我的老师发了两张BASIC编码表。在黑板上，作业写着“编写一个程序，输入并计算10个保龄球得分的平均值。”然后老师离开了教室。这有多难呢？我不记得我的最终解决方案，但我确信其中有一个`FOR/NEXT`循环，并且总共不会超过15行。编码表——对于你们读到这个的孩子们，是的，我们过去写代码时常常先手写出来，然后再输入到电脑里——每张表允许大约有70行代码。我对老师为什么给了我们两张表感到非常困惑。因为我的书写一直很糟糕，所以我用第二张表很整洁地复制了我的代码，希望能因为风格得到几个额外的分数。
- en: Much to my surprise, when I received the assignment back at the start of the
    next class, I received a barely passing grade. (It was to be an omen to me for
    the rest of my time in college.) Scrawled across the top of my neatly copied code,
    "No comments?"

  zh: 让我感到惊讶的是，当我在下一堂课开始时收到了作业，我只得了一个勉强及格的分数。（这成为我大学生涯中的一个预兆。）在我整洁地复制的代码的顶部，写着“没有注释？”
- en: It was not enough that the teacher and I both knew what the program was supposed
    to do. Part of the point of the assignment was to teach me that my code should
    explain itself to the next programmer coming behind me. It's a lesson I've not
    forgotten.

  zh: 仅仅是老师和我知道程序应该做什么是不够的。这项作业的一部分目的是教会我，我的代码应该向后面的程序员解释清楚。这是我没有忘记的一课。
- en: Comments are not evil. They are as necessary to programming as basic branching
    or looping constructs. Most modern languages have a tool akin to javadoc that
    will parse properly formatted comments to automatically build an API document.
    This is a very good start, but not nearly enough. Inside your code should be explanations
    about what the code is supposed to be doing. Coding by the old adage, "If it was
    hard to write, it should be hard to read," does a disservice to your client, your
    employer, your colleagues, and your future self.

  zh: 注释并不邪恶。它们和基本的分支或循环结构一样，对编程是必要的。大多数现代语言都有类似javadoc的工具，可以解析正确格式的注释，自动生成API文档。这是一个非常好的开始，但还远远不够。在你的代码中应该有关于代码应该做什么的解释。按照“如果写起来很难，那么阅读起来也应该很难”的古老格言写代码，对你的客户、雇主、同事和未来的自己都是一种伤害。
- en: On the other hand, you can go too far in your commenting. Make sure that your
    comments clarify your code but do not obscure it. Sprinkle your code with relevant
    comments explaining what the code is supposed to accomplish. Your header comments
    should give any programmer enough information to use your code without having
    to read it, while your in-line comments should assist the next developer in fixing
    or extending it.

  zh: 另一方面，你的注释也可以过分。确保你的注释澄清了你的代码，但不要让它变得晦涩。在你的代码中加入相关的注释，解释代码的目标是什么。你的头部注释应该给任何程序员足够的信息来使用你的代码，而你的内联注释应该帮助下一个开发者修复或扩展它。
- en: At one job, I disagreed with a design decision made by those above me. Feeling
    rather snarky, as young programmers often do, I pasted the text of the email instructing
    me to use their design into the header comment block of the file. It turns out
    that managers at this particular shop actually reviewed the code when it was committed.
    It was my first introduction to the term *career-limiting move*.

  zh: 在一家工作中，我不同意上面的人做出的设计决定。感觉相当刻薄，就像年轻的程序员经常做的那样，我将指示我使用他们的设计的电子邮件文本粘贴到了文件的头部注释块中。结果，这家特定商店的经理在提交代码时实际上审核了代码。这是我第一次听到“职业发展受限的行为”这个词。
