- en: It is not uncommon for teams that are otherwise highly disciplined about coding
    practices to neglect build scripts, either out of a belief that they are merely
    an unimportant detail or from a fear that they are complex and need to be tended
    to by the cult of release engineering. Unmaintainable build scripts with duplication
    and errors cause problems of the same magnitude as those in poorly factored code.

  zh: 对于其他方面在编码实践上非常纪律的团队来说，忽视构建脚本并不罕见，要么是因为认为它们只是一个不重要的细节，要么是因为它们复杂，需要由发布工程师团队来处理。具有重复和错误的难以维护的构建脚本会导致与编码不良代码中的问题同等严重。
- en: One rationale for why disciplined, skilled developers treat the build as something
    secondary to their work is that build scripts are often written in a different
    language than source code. Another is that the build is not really "code." These
    justifications fly in the face of the reality that most software developers enjoy
    learning new languages and that the build is what creates executable artifacts
    for developers and end users to test and run. The code is useless without being
    built, and the build is what defines the component architecture of the application.
    The build is an essential part of the development process, and decisions about
    the build process can make the code and the coding simpler.

  zh: 为什么纪律严明、技术娴熟的开发人员将构建视为工作的次要部分的一个理由是，构建脚本通常是用不同于源代码的语言编写的。另一个原因是构建实际上并不是“代码”。这些理由与事实相悖，即大多数软件开发人员喜欢学习新语言，构建是为开发人员和最终用户创建可执行构件的关键，以便进行测试和运行。没有构建，代码就是无用的，构建定义了应用程序的组件架构。构建是开发过程的重要组成部分，对构建过程的决策可以使代码和编码变得更简单。
- en: Build scripts written using the wrong idioms are difficult to maintain and,
    more significantly, improve. It is worth spending some time to understand the
    right way to make a change. Bugs can appear when an application is built with
    the wrong version of a dependency or when a build-time configuration is wrong.

  zh: 使用错误习惯编写的构建脚本很难维护，更重要的是，很难改进。值得花一些时间了解正确的改变方式。当应用程序使用错误版本的依赖项构建或构建时配置错误时，可能会出现错误。
- en: Traditionally testing has been something that was always left to the "Quality
    Assurance" team. We now realize that testing as we code is necessary to being
    able to deliver value predictably. In much the same way, the build process needs
    to be owned by the development team.

  zh: 传统上，测试一直是留给“质量保证”团队的事情。我们现在意识到，在编码时进行测试是为了能够可预测地提供价值是必要的。同样，构建过程需要由开发团队拥有。
- en: Understanding the build can simplify the entire development lifecycle and reduce
    costs. A simple-to-execute build allows a new developer to get started quickly
    and easily. Automating configuration in the build can enable you to get consistent
    results when multiple people are working on a project, avoiding an "it works for
    me" conversation. Many build tools allow you to run reports on code quality, letting
    you to sense potential problems early. By spending time understanding how to make
    the build yours, you can help yourself and everyone else on your team. You can
    focus on coding features, benefiting your stakeholders and making work more enjoyable.

  zh: 了解构建可以简化整个开发生命周期并降低成本。一个易于执行的构建可以让新开发人员快速轻松地开始。在构建中自动配置可以使多人协作项目时获得一致的结果，避免“在我的机器上可以运行”的对话。许多构建工具允许您对代码质量运行报告，让您及早发现潜在问题。通过花时间了解如何使构建成为您自己的，您可以帮助自己和团队中的其他人。您可以专注于编码功能，使利益相关者受益，并使工作更加愉快。
- en: Learn enough of your build process to know when and how to make changes. Build
    scripts are code. They are too important to be left to someone else, if for no
    other reason than because the application is not complete until it is built. The
    job of programming is not complete until we have delivered working software.

  zh: 了解足够的构建过程知识，以便知道何时以及如何进行更改。构建脚本就是代码。它们太重要了，不能交给别人，即使只是因为应用程序在构建之前并不完整。编程的工作直到交付可工作的软件才算完成。
