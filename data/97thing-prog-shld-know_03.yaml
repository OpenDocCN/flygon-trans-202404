  zh: 提出“用户会做什么？”（你不是用户）
- en: We all tend to assume that other people think like us. But they don't. Psychologists
    call this the false consensus bias. When people think or act differently to us,
    we're quite likely to label them (subconsciously) as defective in some way.

  zh: 我们都倾向于假设其他人和我们的想法一样。但他们不是。心理学家称之为虚假一致偏见。当人们的思维或行为与我们不同时，我们很可能（潜意识地）将他们标记为某种缺陷。
- en: This bias explains why programmers have such a hard time putting themselves
    in the users' position. Users don't think like programmers. For a start, they
    spend much less time using computers. They neither know nor care how a computer
    works. This means they can't draw on any of the battery of problem-solving techniques
    so familiar to programmers. They don't recognize the patterns and cues programmers
    use to work with, through, and around an interface.

  zh: 这种偏见解释了为什么程序员很难站在用户的立场上思考。用户不像程序员那样思考。首先，他们使用计算机的时间要少得多。他们既不知道也不关心计算机是如何工作的。这意味着他们不能利用程序员熟悉的各种解决问题的技巧。他们不认识程序员用来处理、通过和绕过界面的模式和线索。
- en: 'The best way to find out how users think is to watch one. Ask a user to complete
    a task using a similar piece of software to what you''re developing. Make sure
    the task is a real one: "Add up a column of numbers" is OK; "Calculate your expenses
    for the last month" is better. Avoid tasks that are too specific, such as "Can
    you select these spreadsheet cells and enter a *SUM* formula below?" — there''s
    a big clue in that question. Get the user to talk through his or her progress.
    Don''t interrupt. Don''t try to help. Keep asking yourself "Why is he doing that?"
    and "Why is she not doing that?"'

  zh: 发现用户的思维方式最好的方法就是观察一个用户。请一个用户使用与你正在开发的类似软件完成一个任务。确保任务是真实的：“把一列数字相加”是可以的；“计算上个月的开销”更好。避免过于具体的任务，比如“你能选择这些电子表格单元格并在下面输入一个*SUM*公式吗？”——这个问题中有一个很大的线索。让用户谈谈他或她的进展。不要打扰。不要试图帮助。不断问自己“他为什么这样做？”和“她为什么不这样做？”
- en: The first thing you'll notice is that users do a core of things similarly. They
    try to complete tasks in the same order — and they make the same mistakes in the
    same places. You should design around that core behavior. This is different from
    design meetings, where people tend to be listened to for saying "What if the user
    wants to...?" This leads to elaborate features and confusion over what users want.
    Watching users eliminates this confusion.

  zh: 你会注意到的第一件事是，用户会以相似的方式做一些核心的事情。他们试图以相同的顺序完成任务——在相同的地方犯相同的错误。你应该围绕这种核心行为进行设计。这与设计会议不同，那里的人们往往会被听到说“如果用户想要……怎么办？”这会导致繁琐的功能和对用户需求的混淆。观察用户可以消除这种混淆。
- en: You'll see users getting stuck. When you get stuck, you look around. When users
    get stuck, they narrow their focus. It becomes harder for them to see solutions
    elsewhere on the screen. It's one reason why help text is a poor solution to poor
    user interface design. If you must have instructions or help text, make sure to
    locate it right next to your problem areas. A user's narrow focus of attention
    is why tool tips are more useful than help menus.

  zh: 你会看到用户陷入困境。当你陷入困境时，你会四处寻找。当用户陷入困境时，他们会将注意力集中在一点上。这样一来，他们很难在屏幕其他地方找到解决方案。这就是为什么帮助文本是对糟糕用户界面设计的一种不好的解决方案的原因之一。如果你必须提供说明或帮助文本，请确保将其放置在问题区域的旁边。用户狭窄的注意力焦点是为什么工具提示比帮助菜单更有用的一个原因。
- en: Users tend to muddle through. They'll find a way that works and stick with it
    no matter how convoluted. It's better to provide one really obvious way of doing
    things than two or three shortcuts. You'll also find that there's a gap between
    what users say they want and what they actually do. That's worrying as the normal
    way of gathering user requirements is to ask them. It's why the best way to capture
    requirements is to watch users. Spending an hour watching users is more informative
    than spending a day guessing what they want.

  zh: 用户往往是一路混过去的。他们会找到一种行之有效的方法，并坚持下去，无论多么复杂。提供一个非常明显的做事方式比提供两三个快捷方式要好。你还会发现用户说他们想要什么和他们实际做的有差距。这令人担忧，因为收集用户需求的常规方法是询问他们。这就是为什么捕捉需求的最佳方法是观察用户。花一个小时观察用户比花一天猜测他们想要什么更具信息量。
