- en: Whether you call them *bugs*, *defects*, or even *design side effects*, there
    is no getting away from them. Knowing how to submit a good bug report and also
    what to look for in one are key skills for keeping a project moving along nicely.

  zh: 无论您称它们为*错误*、*缺陷*，甚至*设计副作用*，都无法摆脱它们。知道如何提交一个好的错误报告以及如何查看一个好的错误报告是保持项目顺利进行的关键技能。

  zh: 一个好的错误报告需要三个要素：

    make the bug appear.

  zh: 实际发生了什么，或者至少您记录的尽可能多的信息。
- en: The amount and quality of information reported in a bug says as much about the
    reporter as it does about the bug. Angry, terse bugs ("This function sucks!")
    tell the developers that you were having a bad time, but not much else. A bug
    with plenty of context to make it easier to reproduce earns the respect of everyone,
    even if it stops a release.

  zh: 错误报告中报告的信息量和质量既反映了报告者本身，也反映了错误本身。愤怒、简洁的错误报告（"这个函数糟糕透了！"）告诉开发人员您当时的情绪不好，但并没有提供太多其他信息。一个带有足够上下文以便更容易重现的错误会赢得所有人的尊重，即使它阻止了发布。
- en: Bugs are like a conversation, with all the history right there in front of everyone.
    Don't blame others or deny the bug's very existence. Instead ask for more information
    or consider what you could have missed.

  zh: 错误就像一场对话，所有的历史都摆在每个人面前。不要责怪他人或否认错误的存在。相反，请求更多信息或考虑您可能错过了什么。
- en: Changing the status of a bug, e.g., *Open* to *Closed*, is a public statement
    of what you think of the bug. Taking the time to explain why you think the bug
    should be closed will save tedious hours later on justifying it to frustrated
    managers and customers. Changing the priority of a bug is a similar public statement,
    and just because it's trivial to you doesn't mean it isn't stopping someone else
    from using the product.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 更改错误的状态，例如，从*打开*更改为*关闭*，是对您对错误的看法的公开声明。花时间解释为什么您认为错误应该关闭，将节省以后向沮丧的经理和客户辩解的繁琐时间。更改错误的优先级是类似的公开声明，仅仅因为对您来说微不足道并不意味着它不会阻止其他人使用产品。
- en: Don't overload a bug's fields for your own purposes. Adding "VITAL:" to a bug's
    subject field may make it easier for you to sort the results of some report, but
    it will eventually be copied by others and inevitably mistyped, or will need to
    be removed for use in some other report. Use a new value or a new field instead,
    and document how the field is supposed to be used so other people don't have to
    repeat themselves.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 不要为了自己的目的而过度使用错误的字段。在错误的主题字段中添加"重要："可能会使您更容易对某些报告的结果进行排序，但最终会被其他人复制，并且不可避免地会被错误输入，或者需要在其他报告中删除。请使用一个新值或一个新字段，然后记录该字段应如何使用，以便其他人不必重复自己。
- en: Make sure that everyone knows how to find the bugs that the team is supposed
    to be working on. This can usually be done using a public query with an obvious
    name. Make sure everyone is using the same query, and don't update this query
    without first informing the team that you're changing what everyone is working
    on.

  zh: 确保每个人都知道如何找到团队应该处理的错误。通常可以使用一个明显命名的公共查询来完成这个任务。确保每个人都在使用相同的查询，并且在更新此查询之前，务必通知团队您正在更改大家正在处理的内容。
- en: Finally, remember that a bug is not a standard unit of work any more than a
    line of code is a precise measurement of effort.

  zh: 最后，请记住，错误不是标准的工作单位，就像一行代码不是精确的工作量测量一样。
