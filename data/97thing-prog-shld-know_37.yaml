  zh: 努力工作不会有回报
- en: As a programmer, working hard often does not pay off. You might fool yourself
    and a few colleagues into believing that you are contributing a lot to a project
    by spending long hours at the office. But the truth is that by working less you
    might achieve more — sometimes much more. If you are trying to be focused and
    'productive' for more than 30 hours a week you are probably working too hard.
    You should consider reducing the workload to become more effective and get more
    done.

  zh: 作为一名程序员，努力工作通常不会有回报。你可能会自欺欺人，以及一些同事相信你在办公室长时间工作对项目做出了很大贡献。但事实是，通过工作更少，你可能会取得更多成就——有时甚至更多。如果你试图每周保持专注和“高效”超过30个小时，那么你可能工作太辛苦了。你应该考虑减少工作量以提高效率并完成更多任务。
- en: This statement may seem counterintuitive and even controversial, but it is a
    direct consequence of the fact that programming and software development as a
    whole involve a continuous learning process. As you work on a project you will
    understand more of the problem domain and, hopefully, find more effective ways
    of reaching the goal. To avoid wasted work, you must allow time to observe the
    effects of what you are doing, reflect over the things that you see, and change
    your behavior accordingly.

  zh: 这种说法可能看起来违反直觉，甚至有些争议，但这是编程和软件开发作为一个整体涉及到持续学习过程的直接结果。当你在一个项目上工作时，你会更多地了解问题域，并且希望找到更有效的达成目标的方法。为了避免浪费工作，你必须允许时间来观察你所做的事情的影响，反思你所见到的事情，并相应地改变你的行为。
- en: Professional programming is usually not like running hard for a few kilometers,
    where the goal can be seen at the end of a paved road. Most software projects
    are more like a long orienteering marathon. In the dark. With only a sketchy map
    as guidance. If you just set off in one direction, running as fast as you can,
    you might impress some, but you are not likely to succeed. You need to keep a
    sustainable pace and you need to adjust the course when you learn more about where
    you are and where you are heading.

  zh: 专业编程通常不像跑几公里那么辛苦，可以在铺好的道路上看到目标。大多数软件项目更像是一场长距离的越野马拉松。在黑暗中。只有一张简略的地图作为指引。如果你只是朝一个方向出发，尽可能快地奔跑，你可能会给一些人留下深刻印象，但你不太可能成功。你需要保持一个可持续的步伐，并且在了解到更多关于你所处位置和目的地的情况时调整航向。
- en: In addition, you always need to learn more about software development in general
    and programming techniques in particular. You probably need to read books, go
    to conferences, communicate with other professionals, experiment with new implementation
    techniques, and learn about powerful tools that simplify your job. As a professional
    programmer you must keep yourself updated in your field of expertise — just as
    brain surgeons and pilots are expected to keep themselves up to date in their
    own fields of expertise. You need to spend evenings, weekends, and holidays educating
    yourself, therefore you cannot spend your evenings, weekends, and holidays working
    overtime on your current project. Do you really expect brain surgeons to perform
    surgery 60 hours a week, or pilots to fly 60 hours a week? Of course not, preparation
    and education is an essential part of their profession.

  zh: 此外，你总是需要了解更多关于软件开发的一般知识和特定的编程技术。你可能需要阅读书籍，参加会议，与其他专业人士交流，尝试新的实施技术，并了解简化工作的强大工具。作为一名专业程序员，你必须保持自己在专业领域的更新——就像脑外科医生和飞行员被期望保持自己专业领域的更新一样。你需要花时间在晚上、周末和假期自我教育，因此你不能在当前项目加班加点度过你的晚上、周末和假期。你真的期望脑外科医生每周做手术60个小时，或者飞行员每周飞行60个小时吗？当然不，准备和教育是他们职业的重要组成部分。
- en: 'Be focused on the project, contribute as much as you can by finding smart solutions,
    improve your skills, reflect on what you are doing, and adapt your behavior. Avoid
    embarrassing yourself, and our profession, by behaving like a hamster in a cage
    spinning the wheel. As a professional programmer you should know that trying to
    be focused and ''productive'' 60 hours a week is not a sensible thing to do. Act
    like a professional: prepare, effect, observe, reflect, and change.'

  zh: 集中精力于项目，尽可能通过找到聪明的解决方案做出贡献，提高你的技能，反思你正在做的事情，并调整你的行为。避免像笼中的仓鼠一样转动轮子那样丢脸，也不要丢掉我们的职业尊严。作为一名专业程序员，你应该知道每周试图保持专注和“高效”60个小时是不明智的。要像专业人士一样行事：准备，实施，观察，反思和改变。
