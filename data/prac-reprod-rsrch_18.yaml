- en: '![Diagram](jkitzes.png) This study investigated whether several common species
    of bats showed decreased activity adjacent to three large highways near San Francisco
    Bay. Activity in this study was defined as the number of ultrasonic foraging calls
    recorded by autonomous acoustic detectors. The core tasks involved collecting
    raw bat call data using the detectors, extracting specific features of the recorded
    calls, classifying the calls to the species level, and performing statistical
    analysis on the resulting nightly call counts as a function of predictor variables,
    including distance from the road. The complete analysis is described in a [manuscript](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0096341)
    published in *PLoS ONE* in 2014\. We later used a similar workflow to conduct
    a [second study](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2016.03.010), published in *Agriculture,
    Ecosystems & Environment*, of the predictors of bat activity in vineyard landscapes.'

    by the detector manufacturer, with conversion parameters selected to produce output
    similar to the recordings from the native zero-crossing detector. The free, closed-source
    software AnalookW, developed by an individual researcher who has been active for
    many years in bat call analysis, was used to filter out files containing only

    table, which aggregated the calls into passes consisting of multiple, closely

    GLMM was fit to the nightly counts of passes from all species and separately for
    four common species. The model results were saved as a table that later appeared

  zh: 痛点
- en: At the beginning of the workflow, two closed-source graphical programs had to
    be used, one to convert a proprietary data format to the zero-crossing format
    and the second (AnalookW) to perform feature extraction on the zero-crossing call
    files. Both of these steps required parameters to be entered into these programs,
    which I was careful to document manually, as this information can otherwise easily
    be lost. AnalookW runs only on Windows, which required me (and any analysts wishing
    to use my later software BatID) to locate a Windows computer to complete this
    step. Although I write code faster and more accurately in Python, I needed to
    switch to R for statistical analysis, as the necessary packages were not (and
    still are not) available for Python. A major headache at the manuscript stage
    arose because the R statistical functions reported output only as a non-machine-readable
    text file or as an object, which required me to create the final table, containing
    coefficients and standard errors for 14 variables across 5 models, by hand.

- en: Once I created and released the BatID software, a problem immediately arose
    when the scikit-learn package was updated to v0.13, which could not read the classifier
    object created during my analysis. Additionally, the original BatID package required
    a user to install a full scientific Python stack, a task that proved difficult
    for precisely the audience of non-programmers that I was hoping to reach. I eventually
    used pyinstaller to create a standalone binary executable for Windows, reasoning
    that users of the software needed a Windows computer anyway in order to run AnalookW
    as a prior step in the analysis. Creating this distributable binary was not straightforward
    and took many days of trial-and-error testing and manual tuning.

- en: Ironically, of course, in creating a tool for non-programmers, I also created
    another graphical program that cannot easily be scripted into a workflow such
    as the one. I attempted to ameliorate this concern in the most recent BatID version
    by requiring users to create a text file containing all parameters, which is read
    by the program along with the data file, and having the program save all results
    in the same directory as the parameter file, along with a log file. This at least
    ensures that there is, by default, some record of the program version, time, and
    parameters used to process the raw data into classified results tables.

    to this effect, it seems logical to me that in these "high leverage" types of
    analyses, small analytical decisions (how data are cleaned, the options passed
    to optimizers, etc.) could play a disproportionate role in influencing the eventual
    study conclusions, and thus need to be fully documented and shared. An easy way
    to guarantee that all of these decisions are recorded is to make one's entire
    analysis reproducible by others. More broadly, I feel strongly that reproducibility
    is a basic component of good science. Now that "doing science" requires communicating
    more detail than can be easily expressed in narrative form in a manuscript, releasing
    code and data seems completely necessary, where feasible, across all domains.

    necessity (i.e., I invested a ton of time collecting this data and I am going
    to be the one to publish all of the analyses using it) and from the feeling that
    numbers alone cannot possibly capture all the subtle nuances that were observed
    in the field and that are important to truly understanding the data, its potential,
    and its limitations. In particular, information about sampling bias (as derived
    from choices of study site, sampling techniques, season, missing data, and many
    other factors) cannot always easily be described in numeric form. I also suspect
    that many field ecologists recognize that this information often isn't even in
    any published manuscript, leaving the person who collected the data as arguably
    the only one truly qualified to analyze it. What data is published and available
    tends to be relatively small and of heterogeneous format, and thus is often locked
    up in printed pdf tables and other non-machine-readable formats.
