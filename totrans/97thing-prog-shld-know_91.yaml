- en: The importance of the DRY principle (Don't Repeat Yourself) is that it codifies
    the idea that every piece of knowledge in a system should have a singular representation.
    In other words, knowledge should be contained in a single implementation. The
    antithesis of DRY is WET (Write Every Time). Our code is WET when knowledge is
    codified in several different implementations. The performance implications of
    DRY versus WET become very clear when you consider their numerous effects on a
    performance profile.

    Let's say feature *X* consumes 30% of the CPU. Now let's say that feature *X*
    has ten different implementations. On average, each implementation will consume
    3% of the CPU. As this level of CPU utilization isn't worth worrying about if
    we are looking for a quick win, it is likely that we'd miss that this feature
    is our bottleneck. However, let's say that we somehow recognized feature *X* as
    a bottleneck. We are now left with the problem of finding and fixing every single
    implementation. With WET we have ten different implementations that we need to
    find and fix. With DRY we'd clearly see the 30% CPU utilization and we'd have
    a tenth of the code to fix. And did I mention that we don't have to spend time
    hunting down each implementation?

    collections. A common technique to implement a query would be to iterate over
    the collection and then apply the query in turn to each element:'

- en: By exposing this raw collection to clients, we have violated encapsulation.
    This not only limits our ability to refactor, it forces users of our code to violate
    DRY by having each of them re-implement potentially the same query. This situation
    can easily be avoided by removing the exposed raw collections from the API. In
    this example we can introduce a new, domain-specific collective type called `CustomerList`.
    This new class is more semantically in line with our domain. It will act as a
    natural home for all our queries.

    are a performance bottleneck. By incorporating the queries into the class we eliminate
    the need to expose representation choices, such as `ArrayList`, to our clients.
    This gives us the freedom to alter these implementations without fear of violating
    client contracts:'

    scheme with SortedList keyed on our customers level of spending. More important
    than the specific details of this particular example, following DRY helped us
    to find and repair a performance bottleneck that would have been more difficult
    to find were the code to be WET.
