- en: If you are coming from JavaScript, you are probably wondering “where are my
    reusable components?” and “how do I do parent-child communication between them?”
    A great deal of time and effort is spent on these questions in JavaScript, but
    it just works different in Elm. **We do not think in terms of reusable components.**
    Instead, we focus on reusable *functions*. It is a functional language after all!

- en: So this chapter will go through a few examples that show how we create **reusable
    views** by breaking out helper functions to display our data. We will also learn
    about Elm’s *module system* which helps you break your code into multiple files
    and hide implementation details. These are the core tools and techniques of building
    large app with Elm.

- en: 'The README of `elm-sortable-table` has some nice guidance on how to use APIs
    like these and why they are designed as they are. You can also watch the API design
    session where Greg and I figured out an API for `elm-autocomplete` here:'

- en: We talk through a lot of the design considerations that go into APIs like these.
    One big takeaway is that you should not expect to do something as elaborate as
    this for every single thing in your app! As of this writing, NoRedInk has more
    than 30k lines of Elm and one or two instances where they felt it made sense to
    design something as elaborate as this.

  zh: 我们讨论了很多设计考虑因素，这些因素涉及到这样的API。一个很重要的观点是，你不应该期望为你的应用程序中的每一件事都做得像这样复杂！截至目前，NoRedInk有超过30,000行的Elm代码，只有一两个实例他们认为设计成这样复杂是有意义的。

- en: '**Note:** I plan to fill this section in with more examples of growing your
    `Model` and `update` functions. It is roughly the same ideas though. If you find
    yourself repeating yourself, maybe break things out. If a function gets too big,
    make a helper function. If you see related things, maybe move them to a module.
    But at the end of the day, it is not a huge deal if you let things get big. Elm
    is great at finding problems and making refactors easy, so it is not actually
    a huge deal if you have a bunch of entries in your `Model` because it does not
    seem better to break them out in some way. I will be writing more about this!'

  zh: '**注意：** 我计划在这一部分填充更多关于扩展你的`Model`和`update`函数的示例。尽管大致上是相同的想法。如果你发现自己在重复，也许可以拆分一些东西。如果一个函数变得太大，可以制作一个辅助函数。如果你发现相关的东西，也许可以将它们移动到一个模块中。但最终，如果你让事情变得庞大了，也不是什么大问题。Elm非常擅长发现问题并使重构变得容易，因此如果你的`Model`中有大量条目，也不会成为什么大问题，因为似乎没有更好的方法将它们拆分开来。我将会写更多关于这个的内容！'
