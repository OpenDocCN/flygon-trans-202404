- en: Generally, Open Source software is software that can be freely accessed, used,
    changed, and shared (in modified or unmodified form) by anyone. Open Source software
    is typically made by many people, and distributed under licenses that comply with
    the definition.

- en: Free Software is an older and related term that basically says the same thing
    for all our intents and purposes, but we stick to the term Open Source in this
    document for simplicity.

- en: This is basically legalese that says you are allowed to change the code, redistribute
    the code, redistribute binaries built from the code and build proprietary code
    with it, without anyone requiring you to give any changes back to the project—but
    you may not claim that you wrote it.

- en: Early on in the project we iterated over a few different other licenses before
    we settled on this. We started out GPL, then tried MPL and landed on this MIT
    derivative. We will never change the license again.

    include the GNU project, the Apache Software Foundation, a larger company that
    funds the project or similar. The curl project is not part of any such larger
    organization but is completely independent and free.

- en: The curl project obeys national laws of the countries in which it works. However,
    it is a highly visible international project, downloadable and usable in effectively
    every country on earth, so some local laws could be broken when using curl. That's
    just the nature of it and if uncertain, you should check your own local situation.

    case known to the author of this was a patent case in the US that insisted they

- en: As a generic software component that is usable everywhere to everyone, there
    are times when libcurl—in particular—is used in nefarious or downright malicious
    ways. Examples include being used in virus and malware software. That is unfortunate
    but nothing we can prevent.
