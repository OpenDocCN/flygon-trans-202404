- en: 'Back in Unit 1, we wrote a procedure for approximating the square root of a
    given number—let''s call it `x`. The idea was to generate a sequence of better
    and better guesses for the square root of `x` by applying over and over again
    the procedure that improves guesses:'

    eight elements, we know pi is somewhere between 3.28 and 3.02.
