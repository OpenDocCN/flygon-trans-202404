    (Because I work as a root user, so if you login as a non-root user, maybe you
    need `sudo` to execute some commands), what you should do is just download the
    binary package which matches your system from [here](https://golang.org/dl/),
    and uncompress it:'

    been embedded in `Go` binary distributions. If you choose another directory, you
    **must** set `$GOROOT` environment variable:'
