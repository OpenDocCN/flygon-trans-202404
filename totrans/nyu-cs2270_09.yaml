    Wednesday we are going to keep things simple. Starting from the example I posted
    last week, for your homework due Wednesday Nov 18 I would like you to create non-trivial
    3D shapes using triangle strips. You should make at least the following three
    shapes: sphere, cylindrical tube and torus (donut).'

    whether you can make use of splines), feel free to do so. Those more advanced
    shapes will come in handy in the weeks to come.'

    passing in vertices as groups of six values rather than three.
