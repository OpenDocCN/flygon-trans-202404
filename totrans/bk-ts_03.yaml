- en: TypeScript shares something in common with virtually every other computer language
    - a TypeScript program is just a text file. Computers can't run it without first
    transforming that text to machine language. That process is named *compilation*,
    of course, and it isn't exactly a new thing under the sun^([1](#fn_1)).

    Java compiles down to bytecode. A virtual machine interprets that bytecode and
    executes your application. C# and other .NET languages compile down to bytecode
    as well, albeit a different format. They run in a different virtual environment,
    the compile language runtime or CLR)^([2](#fn_2)). If you squint your eyes, even
    web browsers act as virtual machines^([3](#fn_3)).

    agree upon the finer points of the DOM. They may vary their behavior with things
    like the console object. This and that bit of CSS acts different across different
    vendors' browsers (and by versions within the same vendor's browsers^([4](#fn_4))).
    Despite their differences, however, they agree more than they disagree^([5](#fn_5)).
    In most cases the JavaScript I write today runs on every browser on the planet,
    or at least the browsers I care about :).

- en: TypeScript isn't JavaScript, of course. It looks a lot like JavaScript and as
    you'll see, you can write valid TypeScript that is literally identical to pure
    JavaScript. However, no major web browser today can execute TypeScript. There's
    a gap here. Transpilation bridges the gap between TypeScript and JavaScript by
    converting TypeScript to JavaScript.

    tend to use both words in the book.

    code. Many popular IDEs provide a first-class TypeScript experience, including
    Sublime, WebStorm and Visual Studio's younger sibling, Visual Studio Code. The
    JS community has largely embraced VS Code so it's a safe and easy bet. I have
    used VS Code to write all of the examples in this book (and indeed, the book itself)
    and many of the screen captures show VS Code in the background. That said, the
    book is not about VS Code or any other Integrated Development Environment (IDE).
    Pick whichever your prefer.

    them by writing them in JavaScript. This means that you can write your tasks in
    TypeScript too.

- en: An IDE plus the TypeScript compiler gets you most of the way - but not necessarily
    all the way - you want to go. Depending on your IDE, you may also need a task
    runner. Task runners execute ... tasks :). At a bare minimum, you want your task
    runner to invoke the TypeScript compiler as you edit and save changes to your
    TypeScript files. Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code come with integrated task
    runners (MSBuild in the former and an integrated runner in VSCode). You will probably
    outgrow the integrated task runners, however. When this time arrives, have a look
    at gulp, grunt or similar tools. At the time of this writing, [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/)
    and [Webpack 2](https://webpack.js.org/) seem to have the most mind share.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: From here on out, I assume that you have selected an IDE and that your IDE is
    connected to a task runner that automatically compiles your TypeScript whenever
    you make a change and save.

- en: When I first started wondering about TypeScript, one of my very first thoughts
    was - how do I debug it? It turns out to be a very simple and natural process.
    There can be some quirks with web server config because they aren't configured
    to serve up map files the right way. These kinds of problems are all solvable.
    I can't emphasize how much of a nothingburger debugging concerns become once I
    understood the process.

    from above. However, it is quite different from the actual TypeScript code. It's
    not so different that it's impossible to reason about, but it definitely creates
    some unnecessary friction. Thankfully, the TypeScript compiler will generate map
    files for us. These provide a connection between the actual JavaScript the browser
    is running and its associated TypeScript source code.

- en: Map files are pretty interesting things in and of themselves. They don't just
    work for TypeScript, they work more generally with any JavaScript related source.
    For instance, in development situations, you'll often minimize your JavaScript
    but provide a map file that maps the minimized source back to its unminified state.
    Other languages, like ClosureScript, also use map files. The point here is that
    map files weren't invented for TypeScript, TypeScript simply leverages this existing
    capability. [Here's an ancient article](https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/developertools/sourcemaps/)
    that describes source maps when they were first introduced back in 2012\. For
    you historians [this article has also aged well](http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/introduction-source-maps).

    a few people (including me, sad to say) scoffed at the idea. Back then, there
    was no C#, or it was in its infancy. Borland C++ and things like Delphi had a
    lot of mind share, if not market share. It's been quite a journey and fascinating
