  zh: 通过开源实现你的抱负
- en: Chances are pretty good that you are not developing software at work that fulfills
    your most ambitious software development daydreams. Perhaps you are developing
    software for a huge insurance company when you would rather be working at Google,
    Apple, Microsoft, or your own start-up developing the next big thing. You'll never
    get where you want to go developing software for systems you don't care about.

  zh: 很有可能你在工作中不是在开发满足你最雄心勃勃的软件开发梦想的软件。也许你正在为一家巨大的保险公司开发软件，而你更愿意在谷歌、苹果、微软或自己的创业公司开发下一个大项目。如果你为你不关心的系统开发软件，你永远也无法达到自己想要的目标。
- en: 'Fortunately, there is an answer to your problem: open source. There are thousands
    of open source projects out there, many of them quite active, which offer you
    any kind of software development experience you could want. If you love the idea
    of developing operating systems, go help with one of the dozen operating system
    projects. If you want to work on music software, animation software, cryptography,
    robotics, PC games, massive online player games, mobile phones, or whatever, you''ll
    almost certainly find at least one open source project dedicated to that interest.'

  zh: 幸运的是，你的问题有一个答案：开源。世界上有成千上万个开源项目，其中许多项目非常活跃，可以提供你想要的任何类型的软件开发经验。如果你喜欢开发操作系统的想法，可以去参与其中一个十几个操作系统项目。如果你想要开发音乐软件、动画软件、密码学、机器人技术、个人电脑游戏、大型在线玩家游戏、手机应用或其他任何东西，你几乎肯定会找到至少一个专门致力于该领域的开源项目。
- en: Of course there is no free lunch. You have to be willing to give up your free
    time because you probably cannot work on an open source video game at your day
    job — you still have a responsibility to your employer. In addition, very few
    people make money contributing to open source projects — some do but most don't.
    You should be willing to give up some of your free time (less time playing video
    games and watching TV won't kill you). The harder you work on an open source project
    the faster you'll realize your true ambitions as a programmer. It's also important
    to consider your employee contract — some employers may restrict what you can
    contribute, even on your own time. In addition, you need to be careful about violating
    intellectual property laws having to do with copyright, patents, trade marks,
    and trade secrets.

  zh: 当然，世上没有免费的午餐。你必须愿意放弃你的业余时间，因为你可能无法在白天的工作中开发开源视频游戏——你仍然对雇主负责。此外，很少有人通过为开源项目做贡献赚钱——有些人确实赚到了，但大多数人没有。你应该愿意放弃一些业余时间（减少玩电子游戏和看电视的时间不会伤害你）。你在开源项目上工作得越努力，你作为程序员的真正抱负就会实现得越快。还要考虑你的雇佣合同——一些雇主可能会限制你在业余时间里能贡献什么。此外，你需要注意不要违反与版权、专利、商标和商业秘密有关的知识产权法。
- en: Open source provides enormous opportunities for the motivated programmer. First,
    you get to see how someone else would implement a solution that interests you
    — you can learn a lot by reading other people's source code. Second, you get to
    contribute your own code and ideas to the project — not every brilliant idea you
    have will be accepted but some might and you'll learn something new just by working
    on solutions and contributing code. Third, you'll meet great people with the same
    passion for the type of software that you have — these open source friendships
    can last a lifetime. Fourth, assuming you are a competent contributor, you'll
    be able to add real-world experience in the technology that actually interests
    you.

  zh: '对于积极的程序员来说，开源提供了巨大的机会。首先，你可以看到别人如何实现你感兴趣的解决方案——通过阅读别人的源代码，你可以学到很多东西。其次，你可以为项目贡献自己的代码和想法——并不是你提出的每个伟大想法都会被接受，但有些可能会被接受，而且你通过工作和贡献代码学到了一些新东西。第三，你将会遇到与你拥有相同对软件类型的热情的优秀人才——这些开源友谊可以持续一生。第四，假设你是一个称职的贡献者，你将能够在真正感兴趣的技术领域中获得实际经验。  '
- en: Getting started with open source is pretty easy. There is a wealth of documentation
    out there on the tools you'll need (e.g., source code management, editors, programming
    languages, build systems, etc.). Find the project you want to work on first and
    learn about the tools that project uses. The documentation on projects themselves
    will be light in most cases, but this perhaps matters less because the best way
    to learn is to investigate the code yourself. If you want to get involved, you
    could offer to help out with the documentation. Or you could start by volunteering
    to write test code. While that may not sound exciting, the truth is you learn
    much faster by writing test code for other people's software than almost any other
    activity in software. Write test code, really good test code. Find bugs, suggest
    fixes, make friends, work on software you like, and fulfill your software development
    ambitions.

  zh: 开始参与开源项目其实很容易。关于你需要的工具（例如源代码管理、编辑器、编程语言、构建系统等），有大量的文档可供参考。首先找到你想要参与的项目，并了解该项目使用的工具。大多数情况下，项目本身的文档可能会比较简单，但这或许并不重要，因为学习的最佳方式是自己调查代码。如果你想参与其中，可以提供帮助撰写文档。或者你可以开始自愿编写测试代码。虽然这听起来可能不那么令人兴奋，但事实上，通过为他人的软件编写测试代码，你会比进行软件开发中的几乎任何其他活动都学得更快。编写测试代码，真正优秀的测试代码。发现错误，提出修复建议，结交朋友，为你喜欢的软件工作，并实现你的软件开发抱负。
