- en: This is an eBook version of my site [fsharpforfunandprofit.com](http://fsharpforfunandprofit.com),
    created by popular request for people who want to read it offline on their kindle
    or phone. Special thanks to Roman Provaznik for the final nag.

- en: The site (and this book) aims to introduce you to F# and show you ways that
    F# can help in day-to-day development of mainstream commercial business software.
    On the way, I hope to open your mind to the joys of functional programming - it
    really is fun!

    them so that beginner posts come first, and more advanced posts later.

- en: If you are completely new to F#, F# is a general purpose functional/hybrid programming
    language which is great for tackling almost any kind of software challenge.

- en: F# is free and open source, and runs on Linux, Mac, Windows and more. To download
    and install F#, or to find out more, go to [F# Foundation site at fsharp.org](http://fsharp.org).

    F#?"](index2.html) page and then the whole ["why use F#" series](why-use-fsharp.html).
    After that the ["site contents"](index1.html) page provides suggestions for further
    reading on functions, types and more.

- en: There is a page with some advice on [learning F#](index4.html), and if you have
    problems trying to get your code to compile, the [troubleshooting F#](index5.html)
    page might be helpful.

- en: I will assume that you do not need instruction in the basics of programming
    and that you are familiar with C#, Java, or a similar C-like language. It will
    also be helpful if you are familiar with the Mono/.NET library.

- en: On the other hand, I will not assume that you have a mathematical or computer
    science background. There will be no mathematical notation, and no mysterious
    concepts like "functor", "category theory" and "anamorphism". If you are already
    familiar with Haskell or ML, this is probably not the place for you!

    F# is an excellent tool for these domains, but it requires an approach that is
    different from business software.
