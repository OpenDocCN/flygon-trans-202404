    what exactly is the act of making inference. Recall previously we described one
    of the six types of questions you can ask in a data analysis is an **inferential**
    question. So what is inference?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In general, the goal of inference is to be able to make a statement about something
    that is *not observed*, and ideally to be able to characterize any uncertainty
    you have about that statement. Inference is difficult because of the difference
    between what you are able to observe and what you ultimately want to know.

- en: The language of inference can change depending on the application, but most
    commonly, we refer to the things we cannot observe (but want to know about) as
    the **population** or as features of the population and the data that we observe
    as the **sample**. The goal is to use the sample to somehow make a statement about
    the population. In order to do this, we need to specify a few things.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Identifying the population is the most important task. If you cannot coherently
    identify or describe the population, then you cannot make an inference. Just stop.
    Once you’ve figured out what the population is and what feature of the population
    you want to make a statement about (e.g. the mean), then you can later translate
    that into a more specific statement using a formal statistical model (covered
    later in this book).

- en: How did the data make its way from the population to your computer? Being able
    to describe this process is important for determining whether the data are useful
    for making inferences about features of the population. As an extreme example,
    if you are interested in the average age of women in a population, but your sampling
    process somehow is designed so that it only produces data on men, then you cannot
    use the data to make an inference about the average age of women. Understanding
    the sampling process is key to determining whether your sample is *representative*
    of the population of interest. Note that if you have difficulty describing the
    population, you will have difficulty describing the process of sampling data from
    the population. So describing the sampling process hinges on your ability to coherently
    describe the population.

    how different units in the population interact with each other. Typically, without
    any additional information, we will assume that the units in the population are
    *independent*, meaning that the measurements of one unit do not provide any information
    about the measurements on another unit. At best, this assumption is approximately
    true, but it can be a useful approximation. In some situations, such as when studying
    things that are closely connected in space or time, the assumption is clearly
    false, and we must resort to special modeling approaches to account for the lack
    of independence.

    you shouldn’t be fixated on developing a *correct* model; rather you should identify
    a model that is useful to you and tells a story about the data and about the underlying

    to violations in our thinking about the sampling process and the model for the
    population. Obviously, if we cannot coherently define the population, then any
    “inference” that we make to the population will be similarly vaguely defined.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A violation of our understanding of how the sampling process worked would result
    in our having collected data that did not represent the population in the way
    that we thought it would. This would affect our inference in that the inference
    we would make would apply not to the entire population, but to a specific selection
    of the population. This phenomenon is sometimes referred to as **selection bias**
    because the quantities that you estimate are biased toward the selection of the
    population that you *did* sample.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A violation of the model that we posit for the population could result in us
    estimating the wrong relationship between features of the population or underestimating
    the uncertainty of our estimates. For example, if it’s true that penguins can
    influence what color hats other penguins wear, then that would violate the assumption
    of independence between penguins. This would result in an increase in the uncertainty
    of any estimates that we make from the data. In general, dependence between units
    in a population reduce the “effective sample size” of your dataset because the
    units you observe are not truly independent of each other and do not represent
    independent bits of information.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A final reason for a difference between our estimate from data and the truth
    in the population is **sampling variability**. Because we randomly sampled penguins
    from the population, it’s likely that if we were to conduct the experiment again
    and sample another three penguins, we would get a different estimate of the number
    of penguins with turquoise hats, simply due to random variation in the sampling
    process. This would occur even if our description of the sampling process were
    accurate and our model for the population were perfect.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In most cases, differences between what we can estimate with data and what the
    truth is in the population can be explained by a combination of all three factors.
    How big a role each plays in a given problem can be difficult to determine sometimes
    due to a lack of information, but it is usually worth putting some thought into
    each one of these factors and deciding which might be playing a dominant role.
    That way, one may be able to correct the problem, for example, in future studies
    or experiments.
