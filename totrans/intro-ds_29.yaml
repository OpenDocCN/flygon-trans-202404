- en: 'A cluster is a subset of data which are similar. Clustering (also called unsupervised
    learning) is the process of dividing a dataset into groups such that the members
    of each group are as similar (close) as possible to one another, and different
    groups are as dissimilar (far) as possible from one another. Clustering can uncover
    previously undetected relationships in a dataset. There are many applications
    for cluster analysis. For example, in business, cluster analysis can be used to
    discover and characterize customer segments for marketing purposes and in biology,
    it can be used for classification of plants and animals given their features.Â 
    Two main groups of clustering algorithms are:'

- en: An important issue in clustering is how to determine the similarity between
    two objects, so that clusters can be formed from objects with high similarity
    within clusters and low similarity between clusters. Commonly, to measure similarity
    or dissimilarity between objects, a distance measure such as Euclidean, Manhattan
    and Minkowski is used. A distance function returns a lower value for pairs of
    objects that are more similar to one another.
