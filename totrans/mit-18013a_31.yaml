    convergent if the series whose terms are the absolute values of its terms, |a[j]|
    converges.** A series with both positive and negative terms can converge though
    it is not absolutely convergent.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example the harmonic series does not converge at all, so the alternating
    harmonic sequence is not absolutely convergent. The alternating series does however
    converge. The geometric series converges absolutely when |x| < 1 holds. When x
    = 1 it diverges, and when x = -1 it fails to converge but is, in fact, "summable"
    in some sense, as we shall see.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: An absolutely convergent series can be manipulated in many ways without changing
    its value. Thus, you can rearrange its terms, can integrate or differentiate it
    term by term, and treat it essentially as if it were a finite series.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A convergent but not absolutely convergent sequence can be assigned a value,
    but you must be very careful with it. You must not rearrange its terms; that can

    some function of n (which goes to infinity as n increases) by an amount that converges.

    ln(n) by an amount that approaches a constant ![](../Images/d849f7b98afb1020895d9aeb1c987878.jpg),

    are differences of the absolute values of successive terms, and by our first condition
    they all have the signs of their first terms.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Suppose, for example, that a[1] is positive. Then all the terms in the first
    expression are positive, and its partial sums will increase. On the other hand,
    all the terms in the second expression after the first will be negative, and its
    partial sums will decrease. Thus, the even partial sums of our series all be below
    the final sum and will increase while the odd partial sums will be above the final
    sum and decrease.

    between any two successive sums.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: By our second condition differences in successive partial sums (which are the
    terms in the series themselves) approach 0, which means that the values of the
    partial sums are constricted to intervals that approach 0 in size, which implies
    that the partial sums converge in the sense of Cauchy (their differences approach
    0).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Every alternating series obeying the two conditions above with first term positive,
    has the property that the odd partial sums are decreasing and even ones increasing.
    This implies that averaging successive pairs of partial sums gives a better approximation
    to the total sum than the partial sums themselves do.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The alternating harmonic series has the wonderful property that after such averaging,
    the resulting even and odd averages are still increasing and decreasing, and this
    property is preserved if you average pairs of these, and then pairs of what you
    get, and so on. These facts can be used to find the value of this sequence to
    great accuracy, looking only at their first few terms.

    absolute convergence.) With this assumption we can talk about ordinary convergence

    This is NOT small enough for convergence, since this series diverges.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Here is an easy way to see that it diverges. Notice that after the first term,
    there is one more term that is ![](../Images/f60ee2e260022481f38296506a935ef2.jpg)
    or larger (namely the second term), two more that are ![](../Images/3ff3ed19cea37080450d37491d6f7170.jpg)
    larger, four more that are ![](../Images/88b6e6567d0d584f2d8f45e6ab2bd424.jpg)
    or larger, eight more that are ![](../Images/aef2cde373410aab580f631365e7ec3d.jpg)
    or larger and so on. In general, doubling the length of a partial sequence from
    n to 2n provides n new terms each of size at least ![](../Images/ce3c22cb809b1a0df39f74cf3a0645a5.jpg)
    Thus each such doubling of the number of terms increases the partial sum by at
    least ![](../Images/f60ee2e260022481f38296506a935ef2.jpg). The sum going on forever
