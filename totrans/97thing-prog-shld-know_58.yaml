- en: Maybe it's because most of them are smart people, but in all the years I've
    taught and worked side-by-side with programmers, it seems that most of them thought
    that since the problems they were struggling with were difficult that the solutions
    should be just as difficult for everyone (maybe even for themselves a few months
    after the code was written) to understand and maintain.

  zh: 也许是因为他们大多数都是聪明人，但在我教学和与程序员并肩工作的所有年份里，似乎他们中的大多数人都认为，由于他们所面临的问题很困难，所以解决方案对每个人（甚至是自己写代码几个月后）来说都应该同样困难以理解和维护。
- en: I remember one incident with Joe, a student in my data structures class, who
    had to come in to show me what he'd written. "Betcha can't guess what it does!"
    he crowed.

  zh: 我记得有一次和乔在一起的事情，他是我数据结构课上的一个学生，他不得不过来给我看他写的东西。“你肯定猜不到它是做什么的！”他得意洋洋地说。
- en: '"You''re right," I agreed without spending too much time on his example and
    wondering how to get an important message across. "I''m sure you''ve been working
    hard on this. I wonder, though, if you haven''t forgotten something important.
    Say, Joe, don''t you have a younger brother?"'

  zh: '"你说得对，"我同意了一下他的例子，不花太多时间想如何传达一条重要信息。“我相信你在这上面努力了。不过，我想知道，你是否忘记了一些重要的事情。比如，乔，你有一个弟弟吧？”'
- en: '"Yep. Sure do! Phil! He''s in your Intro class. He''s learning to program,
    too!" Joe announced proudly.'

  zh: '"是的。当然了！菲尔！他在你的入门课上。他也在学习编程！” 乔自豪地宣布道。'

  zh: '"不可能！” 乔说。“这很难的！”'
- en: '"Just suppose," I suggested, "that this was real working code and that in a
    few years Phil was hired to make a maintenance update. What have you done for
    him?" Joe just stared at me blinking. "We know that Phil is really smart, right?"
    Joe nodded. "And I hate to say it, but I''m pretty smart, too!" Joe grinned. "So
    if I can''t easily understand what you''ve done here and your very smart younger
    brother will likely puzzle over this, what does that mean about what you''ve written?"
    Joe looked at his code a little differently it seemed to me. "How about this,"
    I suggested in my best ''I''m your friendly mentor'' voice, "Think of every line
    of code you write as a message for someone in the future — someone who might be
    your younger brother. Pretend you''re explaining to this smart person how to solve
    this tough problem.'

  zh: '"就假设吧，"我建议道，“这是真正的工作代码，几年后菲尔被聘用来进行维护更新。你为他做了什么？” 乔只是盯着我眨眨眼。“我们知道菲尔很聪明，对吧？”
    乔点了点头。“我不想这么说，但我也很聪明！” 乔咧嘴笑了。“所以，如果我无法轻松理解你在这里做的事情，而你非常聪明的弟弟可能会对此感到困惑，那么你所写的东西意味着什么？”
    在我看来，乔似乎以一种略微不同的方式看待了他的代码。“那么，我最好用我的最好的‘我是你的友好导师’的声音建议，你可以这样想，每一行你写的代码都是给未来的某个人
    —— 可能是你的弟弟 —— 的一条信息。假装你在向这个聪明的人解释如何解决这个棘手的问题。'
- en: '"Is this what you''d like to imagine? That the smart programmer in the future
    would see your code and say, ''Wow! This is great! I can understand perfectly
    what''s been done here and I''m amazed at what an elegant — no, wait — what a
    beautiful piece of code this is. I''m going to show the other folks on my team.
    This is a masterpiece!'''

- en: '"Joe, do you think you can write code that solves this difficult problem but
    will be so beautiful it will sing? Yes, just like a haunting melody. I think that
    anyone who can come up with the very difficult solution you have here could also
    write something beautiful. Hmm... I wonder if I should start grading on beauty?
    What do you think, Joe?"'

    face. "I got it, prof, I'm off to make the world better for Phil. Thanks."
