- en: The course 18.013A as it appears here is intended as a one and a half term course
    in calculus for students who have studied calculus in high school. It is intended
    to be self contained, so that it is possible to follow it without any background
    in calculus, for the adventurous.

- en: It makes use of some tools that are relatively new, such as applets, which are
    intended to make the subject easier to learn and more fun.

- en: However it was not our intention to make this course merely an easy calculus
    course, covering all the same material as the traditional course, but easier to
    assimilate because of the applets and use of spreadsheets.

- en: Modern labor saving devices in practice do not make life easier and simpler.
    Instead they save us time that allows us to do more in our lives and to make life
    more complicated and busier than ever.

    more and learn more thoroughly with the same amount of, and even perhaps more,
    effort than before.

    is normally attempted in a calculus course.

    of the text as it appears on this site.

- en: Also, though, it is in order to maintain interest in the subject among those
    who have already been exposed to it. Finally, it is to show how easy it now is
    to absorb and use material that not long ago was utterly inaccessible to students,
    rarely taught, and when taught rarely mastered.

- en: Obviously some of the extra material contributes mainly to confuse students,
    some is very badly done though it could be improved, some might suggest to you
    even better things that might be included.

    learn from it. We would be extremely grateful if you would send us via email ([djk@math.mit.edu](mailto:djk@math.mit.edu))
    any comments you have about it, especially from those who don't like something
    they see.

    is new in Chapter 2, and the section on various metrics (3.8) is new in Chapter
    3\. (It probably does more harm than good there.)

    of the concepts of eigenvectors and eigenvalues at this stage is perhaps unusual.

- en: Chapter 6, which involves definition of differentiation in all dimensions is
    novel; but I think it helps make it possible for students to see why the rules
    of differentiation are what they are, and why calculus is useful.

  zh: 第8章没有太多新内容，除了它适用于所有维度。
- en: Probably the major innovations in this course apart from the applets, are the
    sections on numerical analysis, the study of single and multiple variable calculus
    together, introduction of integration in the complex plane, and the applications
    to physics, which while commonplace in physics, rarely are discussed in a calculus
    course.

  zh: 除了小程序之外，这门课程的主要创新可能是数值分析部分，单变量和多变量微积分的研究，复平面中积分的引入以及与物理学的应用。尽管这些在物理学中很常见，但在微积分课程中很少讨论。
- en: Our intent here is to cover enough about more advanced areas of mathematics
    to make students aware of them and to encourage their wanting to learn more about
    them.

  zh: 我们的目的是涵盖足够多关于数学更高级领域的内容，让学生们意识到它们的存在，并激励他们想要进一步学习这些内容。
- en: This material could conceivably be studied by a student on his or her own, but
    this seldom works out. Students tend to get stuck on something, and, having no
    goad to keep them going, they try to get past it with decreasing energy, and ultimately
    develop mental blocks against going on. Having an organized course prevents this
    by forcing them to face obstacles like exams and assignments.

  zh: 这些材料理论上可以由学生自学，但这很少会成功。学生往往会在某些地方卡住，由于没有目标来推动他们继续前进，他们会试图以逐渐减少的精力克服困难，最终对继续学习产生心理障碍。有组织的课程通过强迫他们面对考试和作业等障碍来防止这种情况的发生。

    us and we can try to unstick you.
