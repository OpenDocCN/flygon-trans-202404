- en: '*Everything curl* is an extensive guide to everything there is to know about
    curl, the project, the command-line tool, the library, how everything started
    and how it came to be what it is today. How we work on developing it further,
    what it takes to use it, how you can contribute with code and bug reports and
    why all those millions of existing users use it.'

- en: This book is meant to be interesting and useful to both casual readers and the
    somewhat more experienced developers, and offers something for you all to pick
    and choose from. Don't read it from front to back. Read the chapters you are curious
    about and go back and forth as you see fit.

    open, completely free to download and read, free for anyone to comment on, available
    for everyone to contribute to and help out with. Send your bug reports, pull requests
    or critiques to me and I will improve this book accordingly.'

    may at some point in time consider it fairly complete and covering most aspects
    of the project (even if only that seems like an insurmountable goal), the curl
    project will continue to move so there will always be things to update in the
    book as well.
