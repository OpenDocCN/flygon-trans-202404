- en: 'Specifications are the linchpin of teamwork. It’s impossible to delegate responsibility
    for implementing a method without a specification. The specification acts as a
    contract: the implementer is responsible for meeting the contract, and a client
    that uses the method can rely on the contract. In fact, we’ll see that like real
    legal contracts, specifications place demands on both parties: when the specification
    has a precondition, the client has responsibilities too.'

    We’ll discuss what preconditions and postconditions are, and what they mean for
    the implementor and the client of a method. We’ll also talk about how to use exceptions,
    an important language feature found in Java, Python, and many other modern languages,
    which allows us to make a method’s interface safer from bugs and easier to understand.

    and its client. It makes separate development possible: the client is free to
    write code that uses the procedure without seeing its source code, and the implementor
    is free to write the code that implements the procedure without knowing how it
    will be used.'

- en: '**Safe from bugs**. A good specification clearly documents the mutual assumptions
    that a client and implementor are relying on. Bugs often come from disagreements
    at the interfaces, and the presence of a specification reduces that. Using machine-checked
    language features in your spec, like static typing and exceptions rather than
    just a human-readable comment, can reduce bugs still more.'
