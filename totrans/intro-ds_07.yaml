- en: A categorical or discrete variable is one that has two or more categories (values). 
    There are two types of categorical variable, **nominal** and **ordinal**.  A nominal
    variable has no intrinsic ordering to its categories. For example, gender is a
    categorical variable having two categories (male and female) with no intrinsic
    ordering to the categories. An ordinal variable has a clear ordering. For example,
    temperature as a variable with three *orderly* categories (low, medium and high). A
    **frequency table** is a way of counting how often each category of the variable
    in question occurs. It may be enhanced by the addition of percentages that fall
    into each category.
