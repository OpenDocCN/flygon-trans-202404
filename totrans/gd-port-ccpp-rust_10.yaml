  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Header file (.h, .hpp) contains class definitions, external function signatures,
    macros, templates, inline functions. Sometimes inline functions get stored in
    their own file. The standard template library C++ headers do not have a file extension.
    Some 3rd party libraries like Qt may sometimes omit the extension.

- en: The Source file (.c, .cc, .cpp) contains the implementation of classes and anything
    private. Sometimes C++ will use tricks such as forward class references and Pimpl
    patterns to keep complex or dependent code out of the header file.

    headers with a lot of inline templates or functions.

- en: Compilers are only interested in source files and what they `#include` so what's
    really happening in most C/C++ code is that a preprocessor concatenates various
    header files to the front of the source file according to the `#` directives within
    it and the resulting file is fed to a compiler.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Rust does not have header files. Every struct, implementation and macro resides
    in a file ending in .rs. Code is made public or not by structuring .rs files into
    modules and exposing functions via the `pub` keyword.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Ordering is less important too. It is possible to forward reference structs
    or functions, or even `use` the very same module that a piece of code is a part
    of. The only time that ordering matters is for macro definitions. A macro must
    be defined before a module that uses it.

- en: Using Unicode in C++ has always been a pain. Neither C nor C++ had support for
    it at all, and various solutions have appeared over time. Recent implementations
    of the standards of C and C++ provide string literal types for UTF encodings,
    but prior to that it was strictly ascii or wide characters.

    Latin1, or in fact any form of encoding that predates Unicode. Basically it is
    up to the program to understand the meaning.
