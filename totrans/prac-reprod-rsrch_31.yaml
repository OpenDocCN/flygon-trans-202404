- en: My name is Kyle Barbary and I am currently a postdoc in the physics department
    and a Data Science Fellow in the Institute for Data Science at the University
    of California, Berkeley. I am an observational cosmologist. More specifically,
    I use a particular variety of exploding stars, known as Type Ia supernovae, as
    markers to measure how the universe has expanded over its history. To make this
    measurement as precisely as possible, it is necessary to combine supernova data
    from many different surveys targeting different distances. The workflow I describe
    is about the creation of software tools used to combine and analyze that data
    in a uniform way.

- en: '![Diagram](kbarbary.png) I will describe the development of software for analyzing
    supernova light curve data. A "light curve" in the parlance of my domain is simply
    the brightness of a supernova as a function of time. These brightness measurements
    are derived from images of the same patch of sky spaced in time, ideally showing
    the supernova growing brighter and then fainter. Analyzing these light curves
    is a key step in deriving final results for most supernova cosmology studies.
    The software in question was originally developed for analyzing data from the
    Dark Energy Survey, but it can be (and has been) used for analyzing data from
    other surveys, as I will discuss below.'

- en: The analysis starts from reduced light curve data produced by a separate pipeline
    (not discussed here). A Python script reads the data, performs analysis tasks
    such as model fitting or parameter sampling, and saves the results or produces
    plots allowing the user to visualize the results. There are generally multiple
    scripts for performing different analyses or variations on an analysis, and these
    can be written by several different scientists on the project. The key aspect
    of the process is that all commonly useful functionality is split out into a Python
    *library* (SNCosmo). The top-level analysis scripts contain logic specific to
    the analysis and to the survey, and the SNCosmo library contains functionality
    applicable to a variety of surveys and analyses.

    *库*（SNCosmo）中。顶层分析脚本包含特定于分析和调查的逻辑，而SNCosmo库包含适用于各种调查和分析的功能。

    features of the library are added or refined in response to the needs of various

    where work is centered around an "SNCosmo" GitHub organization. Users who follow
    the development version periodically pull changes from the copy of the repository

    First, continuous integration is done with [Travis](http://travis-ci.org): every
    time a change is made to the GitHub repository, this service is triggered. It
    builds the library and runs the full suite of unit tests for multiple combinations
    of supported library versions. This allows the developers to catch and fix problems
    before they are reported by users. Second, automated documentation builds are
    done by [Read the Docs](http://readthedocs.org). This service builds the library
    and runs the documentation builder which produces a set of HTML pages (and also
    a PDF with the same content). This allows users to see the documentation for the
    latest development version immediately if needed. These two services are free
    for open-source projects and are widely used.'

    published results can include the (relatively short) analysis scripts that were
    used, along with the version of the SNCosmo library used. The fact that the core
    software is a well-documented library means that readers and practitioners can
    more easily understand the specifics of the algorithms used.'

- en: 'To me, reproducibility has two facets: the availability of usable software
    (preferably under an open-source license), and the availability of data (preferably
    in both raw and reduced forms). Together, these should give an outsider the ability
    to reproduce the results of a study from start to finish.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I separate these two aspects because each can be beneficial without the other.
    For example, even without releasing data, it can still be quite beneficial to
    release software. If released under an open-source licence, this provides a different
    flavor of reproducibility - the ability to reproduce an algorithm described in
    a paper and use and improve that algorithm in subsequent work.

    their hard-won data until they have eeked out every possible analysis. I'm sympathetic

    new instrument or even an entire telescope. It can be a very large fraction of
    the work that goes into a project. The threat that someone else will download
