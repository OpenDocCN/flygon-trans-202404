- en: Sass, and it's port libsass, is the leading CSS pre-processor and by far the
    most feature rich. But one thing that separates libsass from others in the JavaScript
    community is that it's not written in JavaScript. It's actually written in C/C++.
    So, the same library is portable to just about any language that a wrapper can
    be written for. And by far the most popular wrapper is `node-sass`.

    to go through some additional, although extremely simple, setup steps.

    in order for Grunt to make use of the library, we need to add the Grunt-Sass package.
