    you’ve completed a good data analysis, you’ve spent more time thinking than doing.
    The thinking begins before you even look at a dataset, and it’s well worth devoting
    careful thought to your question. This point cannot be over-emphasized as many
    of the “fatal” pitfalls of a data analysis can be avoided by expending the mental
    energy to get your question right. In this chapter, we will discuss the characteristics
    of a good question, the types of questions that can be asked, and how to apply
    the iterative epicyclic process to stating and refining your question so that
    when you start looking at data, you have a sharp, answerable question.

- en: A *descriptive* question is one that seeks to summarize a characteristic of
    a set of data. Examples include determining the proportion of males, the mean
    number of servings of fresh fruits and vegetables per day, or the frequency of
    viral illnesses in a set of data collected from a group of individuals. There
    is no interpretation of the result itself as the result is a fact, an attribute

- en: An *exploratory* question is one in which you analyze the data to see if there
    are patterns, trends, or relationships between variables. These types of analyses
    are also called “hypothesis-generating” analyses because rather than testing a
    hypothesis as would be done with an inferential, causal, or mechanistic question,
    you are looking for patterns that would support proposing a hypothesis. If you
    had a general thought that diet was linked somehow to viral illnesses, you might
    explore this idea by examining relationships between a range of dietary factors
    and viral illnesses. You find in your exploratory analysis that individuals who
    ate a diet high in certain foods had fewer viral illnesses than those whose diet
    was not enriched for these foods, so you propose the hypothesis that among adults,
    eating at least 5 servings a day of fresh fruit and vegetables is associated with
    fewer viral illnesses per year.

  zh: 一个*探索性*问题是指你分析数据以查看是否存在模式、趋势或变量之间的关系。这些类型的分析也被称为“假设生成”分析，因为与推论性、因果性或机械性问题需要测试假设不同，你在寻找支持提出假设的模式。如果你一开始有一个大致的想法，认为饮食与病毒性疾病在某种程度上有关联，你可以通过分析各种饮食因素和病毒性疾病之间的关系来探索这个想法。在探索性分析中，你发现那些食用含有某些食物的饮食的人患病病毒性疾病较少，因此你提出假设：在成年人中，每天至少食用5份新鲜水果和蔬菜与每年较少的病毒性疾病有关。
- en: An *inferential* question would be a restatement of this proposed hypothesis
    as a question and would be answered by analyzing a different set of data, which
    in this example, is a representative sample of adults in the US. By analyzing
    this different set of data you are both determining if the association you observed
    in your exploratory analysis holds in a different sample and whether it holds
    in a sample that is representative of the adult US population, which would suggest
    that the association is applicable to all adults in the US. In other words, you
    will be able to infer what is true, on average, for the adult population in the
    US from the analysis you perform on the representative sample.

  zh: 一个*推断*问题将是将这个假设重新表述为一个问题，并通过分析另一组数据来回答，这个例子中，是美国成年人的代表性样本。通过分析这个不同的数据集，您既确定了您在探索性分析中观察到的关联是否在不同的样本中保持，并且它是否在代表美国成年人的样本中保持，这表明该关联适用于所有美国成年人。换句话说，您将能够从您对代表性样本进行的分析中推断出在美国成年人群中平均为真的内容。
- en: A *predictive* question would be one where you ask what types of people will
    eat a diet high in fresh fruits and vegetables during the next year. In this type
    of question you are less interested in what causes someone to eat a certain diet,
    just what predicts whether someone will eat this certain diet. For example, higher
    income may be one of the final set of predictors, and you may not know (or even
    care) why people with higher incomes are more likely to eat a diet high in fresh
    fruits and vegetables, but what is most important is that income is a factor that
    predicts this behavior.

  zh: 一个*预测*问题将是一个您询问在接下来的一年中会吃高含新鲜水果和蔬菜饮食的人的类型的问题。在这种类型的问题中，您对导致某人吃某种饮食的原因不太感兴趣，只是预测某人是否会吃这种特定的饮食。例如，更高的收入可能是最终预测因子之一，您可能不知道（甚至不关心）为什么收入较高的人更有可能吃高含新鲜水果和蔬菜的饮食，但最重要的是收入是一个预测这种行为的因素。
- en: Although an inferential question might tell us that people who eat a certain
    type of foods tend to have fewer viral illnesses, the answer to this question
    does not tell us if eating these foods causes a reduction in the number of viral
    illnesses, which would be the case for a *causal* question. A causal question
    asks about whether changing one factor will change another factor, on average,
    in a population. Sometimes the underlying design of the data collection, by default,
    allows for the question that you ask to be causal. An example of this would be
    data collected in the context of a randomized trial, in which people were randomly
    assigned to eat a diet high in fresh fruits and vegetables or one that was low
    in fresh fruits and vegetables. In other instances, even if your data are not
    from a randomized trial, you can take an analytic approach designed to answer
    a causal question.

    will tell us, if the diet does, indeed, cause a reduction in the number of viral
    illnesses, *how* the diet leads to a reduction in the number of viral illnesses.

    reduction in the number of viral illnesses would be a *mechanistic* question.

- en: There are a couple of additional points about the types of questions that are
    important. First, by necessity, many data analyses answer multiple types of questions.
    For example, if a data analysis aims to answer an inferential question, descriptive
    and exploratory questions must also be answered during the process of answering
    the inferential question. To continue our example of diet and viral illnesses,
    you would not jump straight to a statistical model of the relationship between
    a diet high in fresh fruits and vegetables and the number of viral illnesses without
    having determined the frequency of this type of diet and viral illnesses and their
    relationship to one another in this sample. A second point is that the type of
    question you ask is determined in part by the data available to you (unless you
    plan to conduct a study and collect the data needed to do the analysis). For example,
    you may want to ask a causal question about diet and viral illnesses to know whether
    eating a diet high in fresh fruits and vegetables causes a decrease in the number
    of viral illnesses, and the best type of data to answer this causal question is
    one in which people’s diets change from one that is high in fresh fruits and vegetables
    to one that is not, or vice versa. If this type of data set does not exist, then
    the best you may be able to do is either apply causal analysis methods to observational
    data or instead answer an inferential question about diet and viral illnesses.

  zh: 关于问题类型的一些其他重要要点。首先，出于必要性，许多数据分析回答了多种类型的问题。例如，如果数据分析旨在回答推断性问题，则在回答推断性问题的过程中还必须回答描述性和探索性问题。继续我们的饮食和病毒性疾病的示例，你不能直接跳到一个关于饮食高于新鲜水果和蔬菜与病毒性疾病数量之间关系的统计模型，而没有确定这种类型饮食和病毒性疾病的频率及其在这个样本中彼此之间的关系。第二点是，您所提出的问题类型部分取决于您可用的数据（除非您打算进行研究并收集所需的数据进行分析）。例如，您可能想询问有关饮食和病毒性疾病的因果问题，以了解是否吃饮食高于新鲜水果和蔬菜是否会导致病毒性疾病数量减少，而回答这个因果问题的最佳数据类型是人们的饮食从高于新鲜水果和蔬菜到不高于新鲜水果和蔬菜，或者相反。如果这种类型的数据集不存在，那么您能做的最好的事情可能是将因果分析方法应用于观察数据，或者改为回答有关饮食和病毒性疾病的推断性问题。

    range from the very basic characteristic that the question should not have already

  zh: 对于数据分析的一个好问题有五个关键特征，从基本特征，即问题不应该已经被回答，到更抽象的特征，即问题的每个可能答案都应有一个单一解释且有意义。我们将在下面更详细地讨论如何评估这一点。
- en: As a start, the question should be of **interest** to your audience, the identity
    of which will depend on the context and environment in which you are working with
    data. If you are in academia, the audience may be your collaborators, the scientific
    community, government regulators, your funders, and/or the public. If you are
    working at a start-up, your audience is your boss, the company leadership, and
    the investors. As an example, answering the question of whether outdoor particulate
    matter pollution is associated with developmental problems in children may be
    of interest to people involved in regulating air pollution, but may not be of
    interest to a grocery store chain. On the other hand, answering the question of
    whether sales of pepperoni are higher when it is displayed next to the pizza sauce
    and pizza crust or when it is displayed with the other packaged meats would be
    of interest to a grocery store chain, but not to people in other industries.

  zh: 作为起点，问题应该对你的受众**感兴趣**，受众的身份取决于你处理数据的背景和环境。如果你在学术界工作，受众可能是你的合作者、科学界、政府监管机构、资助方和/或公众。如果你在一家初创公司工作，你的受众是你的老板、公司领导层和投资者。例如，回答室外颗粒物污染是否与儿童发育问题相关的问题可能会引起空气污染监管者的兴趣，但可能不会引起一家杂货连锁店的兴趣。另一方面，回答当意大利辣香肠与披萨酱和披萨皮一起展示时，销售额是否更高，还是与其他包装肉一起展示时销售额更高，这对一家杂货连锁店来说是有兴趣的，但对其他行业的人来说则不是。
- en: You should also check that the question has **not already been answered.** With
    the recent explosion of data, the growing amount of publicly available data, and
    the seemingly endless scientific literature and other resources, it is not uncommon
    to discover that your question of interest has been answered already. Some research
    and discussion with experts can help sort this out, and can also be helpful because
    even if the specific question you have in mind has not been answered, related
    questions may have been answered and the answers to these related questions are
    informative for deciding if or how you proceed with your specific question.

  zh: 你还应该检查问题是否已经有了**答案**。随着数据的爆炸性增长、越来越多的公开数据以及看似无穷无尽的科学文献和其他资源，发现你感兴趣的问题已经有了答案并不罕见。一些研究和与专家的讨论可以帮助搞清楚这一点，而且也可能会有所帮助，因为即使你心中的具体问题没有答案，相关的问题可能已经有了答案，这些相关问题的答案有助于确定你是否以及如何处理你的具体问题。
- en: The question should also stem from a **plausible** framework. In other words,
    the question above about the relationship between sales of pepperoni and its placement
    in the store is a plausible one because shoppers buying pizza ingredients are
    more likely than other shoppers to be interested in pepperoni and may be more
    likely to buy it if they see it at the same time that they are selecting the other
    pizza ingredients. A less plausible question would be whether pepperoni sales
    correlate with yogurt sales, unless you had some prior knowledge suggesting that
    these should be correlated.

- en: 'If you ask a question whose framework is not plausible, you are likely to end
    up with an answer that’s difficult to interpret or have confidence in. In the
    pepperoni-yogurt question, if you do find they are correlated, many questions
    are raised about the result itself: is it really correct?, why are these things
    correlated- is there another explanation?, and others. You can ensure that your
    question is grounded in a plausible framework by using your own knowledge of the
    subject area and doing a little research, which together can go a long way in
    terms of helping you sort out whether your question is grounded in a plausible

- en: The question, should also, of course, be **answerable**. Although perhaps this
    doesn’t need stating, it’s worth pointing out that some of the best questions
    aren’t answerable - either because the data don’t exist or there is no means of
    collecting the data because of lack of resources, feasibility, or ethical problems.
    For example, it is quite plausible that there are defects in the functioning of
    certain cells in the brain that cause autism, but it not possible to perform brain

    yourself what you mean by a “healthier” diet and when you say something is “better
    for you”? The process of increasing the specificity should lead to a final, refined
    question such as: “Does eating at least 5 servings per day of fresh fruits and
    vegetables lead to fewer upper respiratory tract infections (colds)?” With this
    degree of specificity, your plan of attack is much clearer and the answer you
    will get at the end of the data analysis will be more interpretable as you will
    either recommend or not recommend the specific action of eating at least 5 servings

- en: The typical type of question that does not meet this criterion is a question
    that uses inappropriate data. For example, your question may be whether taking
    a vitamin D supplement is associated with fewer headaches, and you plan on answering
    that question by using the number of times a person took a pain reliever as a
    marker of the number of headaches they had. You may find an association between
    taking vitamin D supplements and taking less pain reliever medication, but it
    won’t be clear what the interpretation of this result is. In fact, it is possible
    that people who take vitamin D supplements also tend to be less likely to take
    other over-the-counter medications just because they are “medication avoidant,”
    and not because they are actually getting fewer headaches. It may also be that
    they are using less pain reliever medication because they have less joint pain,
    or other types of pain, but not fewer headaches. Another interpretation, of course,
    is that they are indeed having fewer headaches, but the problem is that you can’t
    determine whether this is the correct interpretation or one of the other interpretations
    is correct. In essence, the problem with this question is that for a single possible
    answer, there are multiple interpretations. This scenario of multiple interpretations
    arises when at least one of the variables you use (in this case, pain reliever
    use) is not a good measure of the concept you are truly after (in this case, headaches).
    To head off this problem, you will want to make sure that the data available to
    answer your question provide reasonably specific measures of the factors required
    to answer your question.

- en: A related problem that interferes with interpretation of results is confounding.
    Confounding is a potential problem when your question asks about the relationship
    between factors, such as taking vitamin D and frequency of headaches. A brief
    description of the concept of confounding is that it is present when a factor
    that you were not necessarily considering in your question is related to both
    your exposure of interest (in the example, taking vitamin D supplements) and your
    outcome of interest (taking pain reliever medication). For example, income could
    be a confounder, because it may be related to both taking vitamin D supplements
    and frequency of headaches, since people with higher income may tend to be more
    likely to take a supplement and less likely to have chronic health problems, such
    as headaches. Generally, as long as you have income data available to you, you
    will be able to adjust for this confounder and reduce the number of possible interpretations
    of the answer to your question. As you refine your question, spend some time identifying
    the potential confounders and thinking about whether your dataset includes information
    about these potential confounders.

- en: Another type of problem that can occur when inappropriate data are used is that
    the result is not interpretable because the underlying way in which the data were
    collected lead to a biased result. For example, imagine that you are using a dataset
    created from a survey of women who had had children. The survey includes information
    about whether their children had autism and whether they reported eating sushi
    while pregnant, and you see an association between report of eating sushi during
    pregnancy and having a child with autism. However, because women who have had
    a child with a health condition recall the exposures, such as raw fish, that occurred
    during pregnancy differently than those who have had healthy children, the observed
    association between sushi exposure and autism may just be the manifestation of
    a mother’s tendency to focus more events during pregnancy when she has a child
    with a health condition. This is an example of recall bias, but there are many
    types of bias that can occur.

  zh: 当使用不适当的数据时可能出现的另一种问题是结果不可解释，因为数据收集的基本方式导致了偏倚的结果。例如，想象一下，您正在使用一份由曾经生过孩子的女性调查创建的数据集。该调查包括有关她们的孩子是否患有自闭症以及她们在怀孕期间是否报告吃过寿司的信息，您发现吃寿司与孩子患有自闭症之间存在关联。然而，由于有孩子患有健康问题的女性会对怀孕期间发生的事情，比如吃生鱼，有不同的回忆，所以观察到的寿司暴露与自闭症之间的关联可能只是母亲在她有孩子患有健康问题时更倾向于回忆怀孕期间事件的表现。这是一个回忆偏差的例子，但是可能发生许多种类型的偏差。
- en: 'The other major bias to understand and consider when refining your question
    is selection bias, which occurs when the data your are analyzing were collected
    in such a way to inflate the proportion of people who have both characteristics
    above what exists in the general population. If a study advertised that it was
    a study about autism and diet during pregnancy, then it is quite possible that
    women who both ate raw fish and had a child with autism would be more likely to
    respond to the survey than those who had one of these conditions or neither of
    these conditions. This scenario would lead to a biased answer to your question
    about mothers’ sushi intakes during pregnancy and risk of autism in their children.
    A good rule of thumb is that if you are examining relationships between two factors,
    bias may be a problem if you are more (or less) likely to observe individuals
    with both factors because of how the population was selected, or how a person
    might recall the past when responding to a survey. There will be more discussion
    about bias in subsequent chapters on ([Inference: A Primer](chap05.xhtml#chapter-inference)
    and [Interpreting Your Results](chap08.xhtml#chapter-interpretation)), but the
    best time to consider its effects on your data analysis is when you are identifying
    the question you will answer and thinking about how you are going to answer the
    question with the data available to you.'

  zh: 在完善您的问题时需要了解和考虑的另一个主要偏差是选择偏差，当你分析的数据是以一种方式收集的，以至于使得具有上述特征的人的比例超过了总体人口的比例时，就会发生选择偏差。如果一项研究宣传称它是关于孕期自闭症和饮食的研究，那么那些既吃生鱼又有孩子患有自闭症的女性更有可能回答调查问卷，而不是那些只有其中一种情况或者两种情况都没有的女性。这种情况会导致您对母亲在怀孕期间摄入寿司与其孩子患自闭症风险的问题得到偏见的答案。一个很好的经验法则是，如果您正在考察两个因素之间的关系，如果由于人群的选择方式或者一个人在回答调查时可能回忆起过去的方式而更有可能观察到具有这两种因素的个体，则偏差可能是一个问题。在接下来的章节中（[推理：入门](chap05.xhtml#chapter-inference)和[解释您的结果](chap08.xhtml#chapter-interpretation)）将会更多地讨论偏差，但考虑其对数据分析的影响的最佳时机是在您确定要回答的问题并考虑如何用您可获得的数据回答问题时。

- en: Joe works for a company that makes a variety of fitness tracking devices and
    apps and the name of the company is Fit on Fleek. Fit on Fleek’s goal is, like
    many tech start-ups, to use the data they collect from users of their devices
    to do targeted marketing of various products. The product that they would like
    to market is a new one that they have just developed and not yet started selling,
    which is a sleep tracker and app that tracks various phases of sleep, such as
    REM sleep, and also provides advice for improving sleep. The sleep tracker is
    called Sleep on Fleek.

    on Fleek。
- en: 'Joe’s boss asks him to analyze the data that the company has on its users of
    their health tracking devices and apps to identify users for targeted Sleep on
    Fleek ads. Fit on Fleek has the following data from each of their customers: basic
    demographic information, number of steps walked per day, number of flights of
    stairs climbed per day, sedentary awake hours per day, hours of alertness per
    day, hours of drowsiness per day, and hours slept per day (but not more detailed
    information about sleep that the sleep tracker would track).'

    and he also knows what types of data are available in the Fit on Fleek database,
    he does not yet have a question. This scenario, in which Joe is given an objective,
    but not a question, is common, so Joe’s first task is to translate the objective
    into a question, and this will take some back-and-forth communication with his
    boss. The approach to informal communications that take place during the process
    of the data analysis project, is covered in detail in the [Communication chapter](chap09.xhtml#chapter-communication).
    After a few discussions, Joe settles on the following question: “Which Fit on
    Fleek users don’t get enough sleep?” He and his boss agree that the customers
    who would be most likely to be interested in purchasing the Sleep on Fleek device
    and app are those who appear to have problems with sleep, and the easiest problem
    to track and probably the most common problem is not getting enough sleep.'

    on Fleek用户睡眠不足？”他和老板一致认为，最有可能对购买Sleep on Fleek设备和应用感兴趣的客户是那些似乎有睡眠问题的人，而最容易追踪的问题，也可能是最常见的问题是睡眠不足。

    The question, “Which Fit on Fleek users don’t get enough sleep?”, seems to be
    grounded in plausibility as it makes sense that people who get too little sleep
    would be interested in trying to improve their sleep by tracking it. However,
    Joe wonders whether the duration of sleep is the best marker for whether a person
    feels that they are getting inadequate sleep. He knows some people who regularly
    get little more than 5 hours of sleep a night and they seem satisfied with their
    sleep. Joe reaches out to a sleep medicine specialist and learns that a better
    measure of whether someone is affected by lack of sleep or poor quality sleep
    is daytime drowsiness. It turns out that his initial expectation that the question
    was grounded in a plausible framework did not match the information he received
    when he spoke with a content expert. So he revises his question so that it matches
    his expectations of plausibility and the revised question is: Which Fit on Fleek
    users have drowsiness during the day?'

    through the exercise of discussing the question with colleagues to gather information
    about the specificity of the question. When he raises the idea of answering this
    question, his colleagues ask him many questions about what various parts of the
    question mean: what is meant by “which users”? Does this mean: What are the demographic
    characteristics of the users who have drowsiness? Or something else? What about
    “drowsiness during the day”? Should this phrase mean any drowsiness on any day?
    Or drowsiness lasting at least a certain amount of time on at least a certain
    number of days? The conversation with colleagues was very informative and indicated
    that the question was not very specific. Joe revises his question so that it is
    now specific: “Which demographic and health characteristics identify users who

    drowsiness at least every other day?”'

    he has. He goes through a thought process similar to the process he used for each
    of the characteristics above. He starts thinking that his question is an exploratory
    one, but as he reviews the description and examples of an exploratory question,
    he realizes that although some parts of the analysis he will do to answer the
    question will be exploratory, ultimately his question is more than exploratory
    because its answer will predict which users are likely to have chronic daytime
    drowsiness, so his question is a prediction question. Identifying the type of
    question is very helpful because, along with a good question, he now knows that
    he needs to use a prediction approach in his analyses, in particular in the model-building
