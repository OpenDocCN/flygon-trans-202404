- en: If you look at any activity, process, or discipline from far enough away it
    looks simple. Managers with no experience of development think what programmers
    do is simple and programmers with no experience of management think the same of
    what managers do.

  zh: 如果你从足够远的地方看任何活动、过程或学科，它看起来都很简单。没有开发经验的经理认为程序员所做的事情很简单，而没有管理经验的程序员则认为经理所做的事情也是如此。
- en: Programming is something some people do — some of the time. And the hard part
    — the thinking — is the least visible and least appreciated by the uninitiated.
    There have been many attempts to remove the need for this skilled thinking over
    the decades. One of the earliest and most memorable is the effort by Grace Hopper
    to make programming languages less cryptic — which some accounts predicted would
    remove the need for specialist programmers. The result (COBOL) has contributed
    to the income of many specialist programmers over subsequent decades.

  zh: 编程是一些人有时做的事情。而最困难的部分 —— 思考 —— 是未经培训者最不可见和最不被赞赏的部分。几十年来，已经有许多试图消除这种技术性思维需求的尝试。格雷斯·霍珀（Grace
    Hopper）尝试使编程语言更少难以理解的早期和最值得记忆的尝试之一，有些报道预测这将消除专业程序员的需求。结果（COBOL）在随后的几十年里为许多专业程序员的收入做出了贡献。
- en: The persistent vision that software development can be simplified by removing
    programming is, to the programmer who understands what is involved, obviously
    naïve. But the mental process that leads to this mistake is part of human nature
    and programmers are just as prone to making it as everyone else.

  zh: 那种认为通过消除编程可以简化软件开发的持续愿景，对于了解其中涉及的程序员来说，显然是幼稚的。但导致这种错误的思维过程是人类本性的一部分，程序员和其他人一样容易犯这种错误。
- en: 'On any project there are likely many things that an individual programmer doesn''t
    get actively involved in: eliciting requirements from users, getting budgets approved,
    setting up the build server, deploying the application to QA and production environments,
    migrating the business from the old processes or programs, etc.'

  zh: 在任何项目中，个人程序员可能没有积极参与的许多事情：从用户那里获取需求、批准预算、设置构建服务器、将应用程序部署到 QA 和生产环境、迁移业务从旧流程或程序等。
- en: When you aren't actively involved in things there is an unconscious tendency
    to assume that they are simple and happen "by magic." While the magic continues
    to happen all is well. But when — it is usually "when" and not "if" — the magic
    stops the project is in trouble.

  zh: 当你没有积极参与事物时，会无意识地假设它们很简单，并以“魔法”发生。当魔法继续发生时，一切都很好。但当 —— 通常是“当”，而不是“如果” —— 魔法停止时，项目就会陷入麻烦。
- en: I've known projects lose weeks of developer time because no one understood how
    they relied on "the right" version of a DLL being loaded. When things started
    failing intermittently team members looked everywhere else before someone noticed
    that "a wrong" version of the DLL was being loaded.

  zh: 有些项目浪费了几周的开发时间，因为没有人理解它们如何依赖于“正确”的 DLL 版本的加载。当事情开始偶尔失败时，团队成员四处寻找，直到有人注意到正在加载“错误”的
    DLL 版本。
- en: Another department was running smoothly — projects delivered on time, no late
    night debugging sessions, no emergency fixes. So smoothly, in fact, that senior
    management decided that things "ran themselves" and they could do without the
    project manager. Inside six months the projects in the department looked just
    like the rest of the organization — late, buggy and continually being patched.

  zh: 另一个部门运行顺利 — 项目按时交付，没有深夜调试，没有紧急修复。事实上，运行得非常顺利，以至于高级管理层决定事情“自己运行”，他们可以没有项目经理。六个月内，该部门的项目看起来就像组织的其他部分一样
    —— 晚期，有缺陷，并不断被补丁修复。

    it doesn't hurt to understand some of it — or to appreciate someone who understands
    the bits you don't.
