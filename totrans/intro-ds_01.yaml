- en: Data Science (a.k.a. **Data Mining**) is about [explaining the past](explaining_the_past.htm)
    and [predicting the future](predicting_the_future.htm) by means of data analysis. 
    Data science is a multi-disciplinary field which combines statistics, machine
    learning, artificial intelligence and database technology. The value of data science
    applications is often estimated to be very high. Many businesses have stored large
    amounts of data over years of operation, and data science is able to extract very
    valuable knowledge from this data. The businesses are then able to leverage the
    extracted knowledge into more clients, more sales, and greater profits. This is
    also true in the engineering and medical fields.
