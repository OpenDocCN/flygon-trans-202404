    the restaurant does not charge them any money. (This makes the game more realistic...?)

    and inclination, you can populate your world with new kinds of people (e.g., college
    students, children, fire-resistant dragon queens), places (Jacobs Hall, libraries,
    death match fighting pits), and especially things (telephones, books, dragon glass
    swords). Oh, the possibilities!

    (a maze) that you can explore. To do so, load the file `~cs61as/lib/labyrinth.scm`.
    (Note: `labyrinth.scm` may need some modification to work with the procedures
    you developed in part two of the project.)'

    rooms before entering so that you can avoid thieves. You might also want your
    character to maintain a list of rooms visited on its property list so you can
    find your way back to the earth's surface.
