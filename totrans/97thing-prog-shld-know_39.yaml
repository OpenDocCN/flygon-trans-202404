    to remove chunks of it.

    Aren't Gonna Need It). Human nature being what it is, we inevitably fell short
    in a few places.

- en: I observed that the product was taking too long to execute certain tasks â€” simple
    tasks that should have been near instantaneous. This was because they were overimplemented;
    festooned with extra bells and whistles that were not required, but at the time
    had seemed like a good idea.

- en: So I've simplified the code, improved the product performance, and reduced the
    level of global code entropy simply by removing the offending features from the
    codebase. Helpfully, my unit tests tell me that I haven't broken anything else
    during the operation.
