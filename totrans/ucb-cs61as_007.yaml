- en: '**CS 61A** is the sister course to CS 61AS. It is offered in the traditional
    lecture-lab-discussion format, and covers the same Big Ideas as 61AS, except in
    the Python language and with a slightly different syllabus. CS 61A is the equivalent
    of Units 1-4 of CS 61AS.'

    of Units 0 and 1 of 61AS, and also aims to provide a gentle intro to Computer
    Science. CS 10 uses a graphical language called Snap! that allows you to program
    by dragging and dropping components.'
