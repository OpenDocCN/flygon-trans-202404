    the y variable to represent its imaginary part. Thus the basis vectors **i** and
    **j** when dealing with complex numbers are the numbers 1 and i, respectively.

- en: Complex numbers have the additional property, that ordinary vectors lack, that
    we can define multiplication among them so as to obey the usual commutative, associative
    and distributive laws of arithmetic. This fact allows definitions of complex valued
    functions by the same sort of rules that we use to define ordinary real functions.

  zh: 它们的定义方式完全相同，唯一的区别是它们实际上是复值函数，也就是说，它们是这个二维复数空间中的向量，每个向量都有一个实部和一个虚部（或分量）。
- en: Most of the standard functions we have previously discussed have the property
    that their values are real when their arguments are real. The obvious exception
    is the square root function, which becomes imaginary for negative arguments.

    any polynomial in z and any power series as well. We define the exponential and
    sine functions of z by their power series expansions which converge everywhere
    in the complex plane.

  id: totrans-56

    greater than it was.

    If so it is discontinuous on the positive real axis, being 0 on one side of it
