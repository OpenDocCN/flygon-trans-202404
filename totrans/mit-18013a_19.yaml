    square roots, something they do not have among ordinary real numbers.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We normally use the x variable to represent the real part of the number and
    the y variable to represent its imaginary part. Thus the basis vectors **i** and
    **j** when dealing with complex numbers are the numbers 1 and i, respectively.

    we can define multiplication among them so as to obey the usual commutative, associative
    and distributive laws of arithmetic. This fact allows definitions of complex valued
    functions by the same sort of rules that we use to define ordinary real functions.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Functions of (x, y) that depend only on the combination (x + iy) are called
    **functions of a complex variable** and functions of this kind that can be expanded
    in power series in this variable are of particular interest.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This combination (x + iy) is generally called z, and we can define such functions
    as z^n, exp(z), sin z, and all the standard functions of z as well as of x.
  prefs: []

- en: They are defined in exactly the same way the only difference being that they
    are actually complex valued functions, that is, they are vectors in this two dimensional
    complex number space, each with a real and an imaginary part (or component).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Most of the standard functions we have previously discussed have the property
    that their values are real when their arguments are real. The obvious exception
    is the square root function, which becomes imaginary for negative arguments.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Since we can multiply z by itself and by any other complex number, we can form
    any polynomial in z and any power series as well. We define the exponential and
    sine functions of z by their power series expansions which converge everywhere
    in the complex plane.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Since all the operations that produce standard functions can be applied to complex
    functions we can produce all the standard functions of a complex variable by the
    same steps as go to producing standard functions of real variables.

    in the r dimension is 0 where the derivative is defined. There is a similar statement
    about any function, f of the variable z, with z = x + iy.

    gradient vectors at appropriate points together into paths, which are sometimes

    is not a well defined function in the complex plane, and so neither is ln z.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The difficulty is that as we wander around the origin in a counterclockwise
    direction, the angle keeps increasing and comes back after each revolution 2![](../Images/14a5527d559efd556ba1581aab6c8a73.jpg)
    greater than it was.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    there; unless you artificially restrict its angle say to range from -![](../Images/14a5527d559efd556ba1581aab6c8a73.jpg)
    to ![](../Images/14a5527d559efd556ba1581aab6c8a73.jpg). If you do that the function
    ln z is discontinuous on the negative real axis.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The prosaic way is to define such inverse functions precisely by introducing
    **a line of discontinuity for them, called a cut.**
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Thus for the logarithm you can say that its imaginary part, ![](../Images/fbfd66d68df998c4aef5ec2c51867a7e.jpg),
    has values that run from 0 to 2![](../Images/14a5527d559efd556ba1581aab6c8a73.jpg).
    If so it is discontinuous on the positive real axis, being 0 on one side of it
    and 2![](../Images/14a5527d559efd556ba1581aab6c8a73.jpg) on the other.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    to +![](../Images/14a5527d559efd556ba1581aab6c8a73.jpg), so that its line of discontinuity
    is the negative real axis, and you can choose any other half line of discontinuity
    starting at the origin.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another way to handle this problem is to replace the complex plane by a geometric
    structure called a **Riemann surface,** on which the function in question is single
    valued without a discontinuity.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the case of the logarithm this surface winds around and around the origin.
    For the square root if you go around the origin twice you come back to where you
    started from.
