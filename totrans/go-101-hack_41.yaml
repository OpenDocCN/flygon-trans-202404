- en: You needn't close every channel when you've finished with it. It's only necessary
    to close a channel when it is important to tell the receiving goroutines that
    all data have been sent. A channel that the garbage collector determines to be
    unreachable will have its resources reclaimed whether or not it is closed. (Don't
    confuse this with the close operation for open files. It is important to call
    the Close method on every file when you've finished with it.)
