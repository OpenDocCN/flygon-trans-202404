- en: Hierarchical clustering involves creating clusters that have a predetermined
    ordering from top to bottom. For example, all files and folders on the hard disk
    are organized in a hierarchy. There are two types of hierarchical clustering,
    *Divisive* and *Agglomerative*.

    cluster and then partition the cluster to two least similar clusters. Finally,
    we proceed recursively on each cluster until there is one cluster for each observation.'

- en: In this method we assign each observation to its own cluster. Then, compute
    the similarity (e.g., distance) between each of the clusters and join the two
    most similar clusters. Finally, repeat steps 2 and 3 until there is only a single
    cluster left. The related algorithm is shown below.

- en: Before any clustering is performed, it is required to determine the proximity
    matrix containing the distance between each point using a distance function. Then,
    the matrix is updated to display the distance between each cluster. The following
    three methods differ in how the distance between each cluster is measured. **Single
    Linkage**In single linkage hierarchical clustering, the distance between two clusters
    is defined as the *shortest* distance between two points in each cluster. For
    example, the distance between clusters �r� and �s� to the left is equal to the
    length of the arrow between their two closest points.

    between two clusters is defined as the *longest* distance between two points in
    each cluster. For example, the distance between clusters �r� and �s� to the left
    is equal to the length of the arrow between their two furthest points.'

    between two clusters is defined as the average distance between each point in
    one cluster to every point in the other cluster. For example, the distance between
    clusters �r� and �s� to the left is equal to the average length each arrow between
    connecting the points of one cluster to the other.'
