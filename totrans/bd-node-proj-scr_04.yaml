- en: I’ve found myself using Gulp for just about everything involving HTML/CSS/JS
    these days. It’s super fast, quick to write scripts for and flexible. I’m at a
    point now where I have a ton of projects I can just cd into, run gulp and be up
    and running. It’s the best solution I’ve found for delivering static assets whether
    for local development or production.

- en: With gulp starting to find itself into my everyday workflow - I've started to
    understand its quirks and twists, and how to get along with it. My baseline gulfile.js
    has become a lot neater and advanced in its functionality that the one I originally
    developed back in March.
