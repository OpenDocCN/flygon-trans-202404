    Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning library. All formulas and concepts
    will be presented with code in both Matlab and Python.

- en: Today we have a lot of confusion around artificial intelligence, machine learning,
    and deep learning. Actually those terms are just a subset of the Artificial Intelligence.

- en: Field of study which studies how to create computing systems that are capable
    of intelligent behavior. Some other texts define as the study/design of intelligent
    agents. Here agent is a system(Software/Hardware) that perceives its environment
    and takes actions that maximize its chances of success.

- en: For the scope of this book, an intelligent agent is an agent that solve a problem
    optimally, which means that the system will figure out alone what is the best
    course of action to take.

    a new action with one of them.

- en: Before take an action, simulate all the possible outcomes (was a good or bad
    action) then choose the less bad. So you need an abstraction (model) of the world,
    just remember that a model of the world is not the world.

    solved it''s not called intelligent anymore... (ie: Make a computer play chess
    was the highest display of intelligence, now people don''t consider that anymore)'

    why we have now this buzzword?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    systems, and FPGAs) and the availability of data (Big data) through internet.

- en: Also the amount of data that need to be classified nowadays become to big to
    be handled manually, so big companies Google, Microsoft, Facebook, start to invest
    heavily on the subject.
