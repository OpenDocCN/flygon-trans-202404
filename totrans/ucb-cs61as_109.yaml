- en: Unit 2 dealt with compound data as a means for constructing computational objects
    that have several parts. We abstracted their constructors and selectors and saw
    how they can be formed by nesting pairs and lists. But, we learned from Lesson
    7 that there is another aspect of data that Unit 2 did not address. We are now
    able to mutate data with `set!`, and there is a similar operation for pairs. We
    will explore `mutators`, operations that modify data objects.

    manipulating lists and structure hierarchy. We are going to see how we can mutate
    the elements and structure of pairs.
