- en: We would like to write code that is correct, and have evidence on hand that
    it is correct. It can help with both issues to think about the "size" of a function.
    Not in the sense of the amount of code that implements a function — although that
    is interesting — but rather the size of the mathematical function that our code
    manifests.

- en: 'For example, in the game of Go there is a condition called *atari* in which
    a player''s stones may be captured by their opponent: A stone with two or more
    free spaces adjacent to it (called *liberties*) is not in atari. It can be tricky
    to count how many liberties a stone has, but determining atari is easy if that
    is known. We might begin by writing a function like this:'

- en: This is larger than it looks. A mathematical function can be understood as a
    set, some subset of the Cartesian product of the sets that are its domain (here,
    `int`) and range (here, `boolean`). If those sets of values were the same size
    as in Java then there would be `2L*(Integer.MAX_VALUE+(-1L*Integer.MIN_VALUE)+1L)`
    or 8,589,934,592 members in the set `int×boolean`. Half of these are members of
    the subset that is our function, so to provide complete evidence that our function
    is correct we would need to check around 4.3×10⁹ examples.

    Tests can demonstrate the presence of features, though. But still we have this
    issue of size.

    of a stone is not any int, but exactly one of {1,2,3,4}. So we could alternatively
    write:'

- en: 'This is much more tractable: The function computed is now a set with at most
    eight members. In fact, four checked examples would constitute evidence of complete
    certainty that the function is correct. This is one reason why it''s a good idea
    to use types closely related to the problem domain to write programs, rather than
    native types. Using domain–inspired types can often make our functions much smaller.
    One way to find out what those types should be is to find the examples to check
    in problem domain terms, before writing the function.'
