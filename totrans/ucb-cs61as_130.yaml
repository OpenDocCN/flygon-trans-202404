- en: 'Modify the metacircular evaluator to allow type-checking of arguments to procedures.
    Here is how the feature should work. When a new procedure is defined, a formal
    parameter can be either a symbol as usual or else a list of two elements. In this
    case, the second element is a symbol, the name of the formal parameter. The first
    element is an expression whose value is a predicate function that the argument
    must satisfy. That function should return `#t` if the argument is valid. For example,
    here is a procedure foo that has typechecked parameters num and list:'

    `num` and `list`. When `foo` is invoked, the evaluator will check to see that
    the first actual argument is an integer and that the second actual argument is
    not empty. The expression whose value is the desired predicate function should
    be evaluated with respect to `foo`''s defining environment. (Hint: Think about
    extend-environment.)'
