- en: Predictive modeling is the process by which a model is created to predict an
    outcome. If the outcome is categorical it is called [classification](classification.htm)
    and if the outcome is numerical it is called [regression](regression.htm).Â  Descriptive
    modeling or [clustering](clustering.htm) is the assignment of observations into
    clusters so that observations in the same cluster are similar. Finally, [a](association_rules.htm)[ssociation
    rules](association_rules.htm) can find interesting associations amongst observations.
