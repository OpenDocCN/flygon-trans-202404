    we will now shift focus to a collection of concrete examples of scientific research
    workflows, all of which strive to attain a high degree of reproducibility. These
    case studies of reproducible research are the foundation for our study of approaches
    and current best practices for achieving computational reproducibility. By studying
    these real-world examples, we are able to draw conclusions regarding the tools,
    software, and current trends of reproducible scientific research.

    studies, including the motivating factors behind the general framework of a case
    study. Next, we describe the methods and process of collecting the case studies
    from researchers spanning a range of scientific disciplines. The case studies
    themselves shed light upon a natural classification into two distinct categories.
    This classification is described, and an index of the case studies is provided.
    As a high level summary, we next present broad descriptions and summary statistics
    of the case studies. These provide insight into the currently most common tools
    and methodologies facilitating reproducible research. Finally, we provide some
    suggestions for reading the case study chapters to attain a deeper understanding
    of these examples. These suggestions are intended to help readers identify ideas
    and insights for crafting their own reproducible scientific research workflows.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A case study is a comprehensive description of the computational workflow that
    a researcher used to complete a single, well-defined scientific research project.
    Each case study describes how particular tools, ideas, and practices have been
    combined to support reproducibility. Emphasis is placed on the *how*, rather than
    the why or what, of reproducible research. Each case study can be viewed as one
    approach among many possibilities for how a researcher approached the challenge
    of reproducibility.

- en: 'Each case study follows a consistent, standardized format. Each begins with
    a short biography of the author, including their affiliation, discipline, and
    a brief abstract describing the subject of their case study. The body of each
    case study consists of the three core sections: a workflow narrative accompanied
    by a flowchart diagram, a discussion of the most important tools and achievements
    of the workflow, and a discussion of the most significant problems encountered
    in achieving reproducibility.'

- en: 'The workflow narrative and diagram are the heart of each case study. The diagram
    outlines the project in a manner similar to a circuit diagram: boxes represent
    steps in the process, and arrows represent the flow of information into subsequent
    steps. Most diagrams are built around combinations of specialized tools, version
    controlled repositories, databases, scripts, and end products such as statistical
    conclusions, functional software, or scientific publication. The workflow narrative
    ties closely to the diagram, and explains various stages and flow of information
    shown in the diagram. The narrative provides an opportunity for authors to discuss
    topics such as the appropriate use of tools, how various steps were automated,
    the history of raw data, and whether the software that is used for analysis is
    publicly available with sufficient documentation and testing.'

    main successes of reproducible research from the project. This *Key Benefits*
    section describes the ways in which following this reproducible workflow has improved
    the author's research, often by making it more efficient, transparent, and trustworthy
    in addition to more reproducible. This section may also discuss how the project
    benefited from the reproducible or open-source nature of other projects and how
    other researchers could reuse portions of the workflow.

- en: Finally, in the *Pain Points* section, each case study reflects on the most
    troublesome obstacles encountered in the pursuit of reproducibility. These challenges
    may have been successfully navigated, or may still remain. Examples include data
    sets that could not be made publicly available, legacy code inherited from other
    scientists, or difficulties in collaborating with other scientists without experience
    or interest in reproducible research. These troublesome aspects should be equally
    as instructive as the successes and key tools, since they highlight the practical
    hurdles to producing fully reproducible research.

    out any software or other tools that helped achieve a reproducible workflow. And
    finally, some case studies address several optional questions, which touch on
    the broader context of reproducible research and its challenges. Where provided,
    answers to these questions are included at the close of the case study. The optional
    questions posed to each author were:'

    studies from contributing authors. This format was selected to serve several purposes.
    Foremost, the workflow narrative and diagram are intended to provide a clear visualisation
    of the end-to-end scientific workflow, as well as the author's commentary and
    description of this process. Either alone would not provide a comprehensive idea
    of their approach to achieving reproducibility. Second, the remaining sections
    are designed to clearly distinguish important aspects of the researchers' approach
    to reproducibility. While similar information may also appear in the workflow
    narrative, the *Key Benefits*, *Pain Points*, and *Key Tools* sections isolate
    these concepts, and force each author to reflect clearly on the strengths and
    weaknesses of their approach. Combined, these sections provide a comprehensive
    view of authors approach and experiences in their quest to achieve reproducibility.

    the Berkeley Institute for Data Science, at the University of California, Berkeley.
    This process of collecting case studies spanned a period of approximately six
    months.

    study. At its inception, this consisted only of the workflow diagram and accompanying
    narrative. Members of this group each wrote a case study describing one of their
    own research projects. After examining these initial submissions, a formal template
    for a case study was created. This consisted of the introductory biographical
    questions for each author, a description and guidelines for the narrative and
    diagram, and a set of questions regarding various aspects of reproducibility.

    hosted at the Berkeley Institute for Data Science. One session of this workshop
    gave attendees the opportunity to draft a case study describing their own research.
    Although attendees only had a few hours to work on their submissions during the
    workshop, the majority took additional time after the workshop to finalize their
    case study. A third and final round of case studies was later elicited through
    personal requests to leading scientific researchers.

    divided into three main stages: data input/acquisition, data processing, and data
    analysis and outputs. The first stage represents data acquisition, input, or creation.
    Regardless of the source of the data (via collection, simulation, or otherwise),
    the final result of this stage is one or more raw data sets. The second stage
    includes both cleaning and processing of this raw data. This can include many
    different tasks such as consolidating, organizing, or digitizing, the output of
    which is a cleaned dataset fully prepared for the third stage. Finally, the third
    stage includes all statistical analyses, visualizations, and the creation of output
    products. This may frequently result in scientific publication, but many other
    forms of output are possible, such as software tools, public repositories, scientific
    conclusions, or actionable insights. An outline of a fully generic scientific
    workflow into these three distinct stages is shown in Figure 1.'

    this three-stage taxonomy, the case studies naturally fell into one of two broad
    categories. The first we called "high-level" case studies, which describe a complete
    scientific workflow involving all three stages. These generally provide a lighter
    treatment of each stage, and contain fewer technical details. The second category
    is called "low-level" case studies, which consists of those case studies describing
    only one or two of these three stages. These low-level examples generally provide
    a more detailed or technical treatment of the various stages. Low-level case studies
    are further classified by which stage(s) they describe.'

    exist between the various case studies. Here, we summarize several of the main
    trends and the emergent characteristics which can be observed. This includes a
    summary of the main languages used for computational research, trends in data
    sharing and version control, and other high level properties.

- en: This book contains a total of 31 contributed case studies of reproducible workflows.
    Among them, 21 are high-level workflows describing the end-to-end process including
    data input or acquisition, data processing, and data analysis. The remaining 10
    case studies are low-level workflows, which provide greater detail on one or two
    of these stages. Approximately one third of the low-level case studies discuss
    data input or acquisition (Stage 1), half describe data processing (Stage 2),
    and half discuss data analysis (Stage 3). Note that some low-level case studies
    cover two of these stages, for example both data processing and data analysis.

- en: Each of the 31 case studies represent a data-centric computational scientific
    workflow, and therefore describes various tools or languages for data management,
    data processing, or scientific computing. Although myriad computational tools
    are described, a few are extremely widely represented among the case studies.
    In particular, 17 of the 31 case studies (55%) make use of Python, an open-source,
    high-level and general-purpose programming language. This accurately reflects
    the current popularity of Python, thanks to to rapid development cycle, the high
    readability of Python code, and the extremely wide range of applications supported
    by Python. The next strongest representation is of R, an open source programming
    language for statistical computing, which is used in 13 of the 31 case studies
    (42%). This is an accurate representation of the wide-spread use of R among data
    analysts, and generally the statistics community at large, as R is now considered
    the primary ecosystem for statistical computing. Following Python and R, a vast
    range of other programs and computational tools have a comparatively modest representation
    among the case studies. To name just a few of the more mainstream tools, these
    include C/C++, MATLAB, Julia, Scala, Java/JavaScript, and oftentimes custom-developed
    software, although this listing is far from comprehensive.

- en: Appropriate use of version control is a key aspect of modern reproducibility.
    This applies equally for software development and the computer code underlying
    computational workflows. Older (centralized) version control systems were more
    cumbersome for users, but the recent introduction of git and GitHub have made
    version control more accessible for smaller-scale projects. The vast majority
    (over 80%) of the case studies make use of git and GitHub for version controlling
    the development of software or analysis code, which represents one of the strongest
    trends among the case studies. A number of the remaining case studies explain
    that the nature of the workflow is not appropriate for version control, for example
    when describing a protocol for data management. Further, a few case studies make
    use of other version control software -- for example, Bitbucket or SVN -- but
    these represent a small minority.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In support of transparency and reproducibility, there is an on-going shift within
    academic communities in support of open data and data sharing. Indeed, 19 of the
    31 case studies (over 60%) make use of publicly available data, or themselves
    describe the process of making their data publicly available. However, an open-data
    policy is not universally practiced, as in some disciplines the extreme overhead
    of data collection deters scientists from openly sharing it. That is an unfortunate
    reality in some fields, for example cosmology, astrophysics, or neuroscience,
    but the current trend among the scientific and academic communities is strongly
    moving towards the use of open data.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There is also a clear trend in the output medium of the case studies, although
    we believe this may be an artifact of the contributing group of authors rather
    than of reproducible workflows in general. The collection of case studies was
    drawn from the academic community, where primary emphasis is placed on scientific
    publication. All but a few of the case study workflows culminate in producing
    a scientific manuscript intended for peer-reviewed publication. Perhaps more important,
    slightly over one third of the case studies also describe a second output. This
    is typically manifested as a software product, or an analysis algorithm intended
    for wider use. Other, less common, secondary outputs include data management pipelines,
    or interactive websites.

    a wealth of knowledge and experience is available in the case studies presented
    at the end of this book. However, reading the case studies may be daunting, as
    many are technical and may assume familiarity with computational tools or specific
    application domains. For this reason, we now provide some suggestions for reading
    the case studies.

    through the high-level case studies, which provide a general overview of research
    workflows from a variety of disciplines. This will provide a general idea of what
    is contained in the case studies, and may highlight disciplines that have faced,
    or have solved, similar challenges to those faced by the reader. Ecologists and
    cosmologists, for example, both often work with high-resolution spatial data,
    while neuroscientists and empirical economists may encounter similar issues surrounding
    data anonymization.

    they might next consider a detailed reading of the case studies drawn from the
    most closely related disciplines to their own. In these examples, the nature of
    the scientific research is more likely to be familiar to the reader. In addition,
    they are likely to give an idea of what tools, challenges and approaches are being
    used in one's own discipline.

    both high-level and low-level case studies which address the tools or issues most
    closely related to your own research. Case studies will invariably discuss technical
    tools, topics, and methods that will not be familiar to you. Rather than including
    explanations of these technical concepts in each chapter, we have provided descriptions
    of the most common terms and tools in a technical glossary at the end of the book.
    Readers are encouraged to refer to this glossary frequently while reading through
    the case studies.

- en: It is important to note that each case study is a problem-specific example of
    a reproducible workflow. Rather than attempting to recreate any particular workflow,
    ideas should be selected from a variety of case studies to create your own customized
    approach to reproducibility. However readers decide to navigate the collection
    of case studies, they should keep in mind that *every* case study has some useful
    insights to offer -- including those drawn from unrelated disciplines. We encourage
    readers to study a variety of the workflows presented, since this approach is
    most likely to give a flavor of the common techniques and best practices generally
    applicable to scientific research.
