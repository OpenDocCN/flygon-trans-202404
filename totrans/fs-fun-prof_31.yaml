    at all. I would say that this a dangerous thing to do, especially if you are learning.

    explicit about what you are trying to do.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With only a tiny bit of effort I came up with some explicit requirements that
    I could use for verification later.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    unfortunately lacking in the TDD demonstration.

    always worthwhile spending time to *really* understand the domain you are working
    in.

    with the design later. (Plus I learned what "bi-quinary" means and got to use
    it in this post!)

    First zero, then one, and so on.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As I note above, I feel very uncomfortable with this approach because (a) I
    don't think it leads to a good design and (b) the single cases don't cover all
    possible inputs.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I would strongly recommend that you write tests that map *directly* to the requirements.
    If the requirements are any good, this will mean that the tests cover many inputs
    at once, so you can then test as many inputs as you can.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Ideally, you would use a property-based testing tool like QuickCheck. Not only
    does it make this approach much easier to implement, but it forces you to identify
    what the properties of your design should be, which in turn helps you clarify
    any fuzzy requirements.

    recursive one demonstrated in the TDD video.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Both designs were derived directly from an understanding of the domain. The
    first from using tally marks, and the second from using an abacus.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To my mind, both of these designs were also easier to understand -- no recursion!
    -- and thus easier to have confidence in.

    katas. There is no conflict, and I cannot see why they would be controversial.
