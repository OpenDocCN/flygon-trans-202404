- en: You've seen how to implement a Scheme interpreter in Lesson 11 (`mceval.scm`).
    For this project, you will be helping us construct a Python interpreter called
    Schython (Scheme + Python = Schython).

- en: Python is a modern and very popular language used for teaching introductory
    CS courses, and is the language used in CS 61A. We will go over the basics of
    the Python language necessary to write the Schython interpreter in the spec. But,
    if you are interested (this is not at all required for this project), you can
    take a look at [Python's documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html)
    for a more comprehensive breakdown of the language.
