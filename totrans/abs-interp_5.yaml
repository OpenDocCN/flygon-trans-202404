- en: The notion of abstract domain in abstract interpretation (see **Sec. [3.1](#sec:abs-dom)**)
    is independent of particular applications and can be implemented in libraries
    which can be used as parts of many different static analyses and even substituted
    for one another. Such libraries implement a representation of abstract properties
    and algorithms encoding operations on these properties such as logical operations,
    property transformers, widenings, etc.

    coefficients (with C and OCaml interfaces).

- en: The [Parma Polyhedra Library (PPL)](http://www.cs.unipr.it/ppl/) is a user-friendly,
    fully dynamic, portable, exception-safe, and efficient C++ library to handle convex
    polyhedra that can be defined as the intersection of a finite number of (open
    or closed) hyperspaces, each described by an equality or inequality (strict or
    non-strict) with rational coefficients.

- en: The [Octagon Abstract Domain Library](http://www.di.ens.fr/~mine/oct/) is a
    library for manipulating special kinds of polyhedra called octagons that correspond
    to sets of constraints of the form +/-*x* +/-*y* ≤ *c* (where *x* and *y* are
    variables and *c* a rational constant and so, in dimension two, these polyhedra
    have at most eight faces) [[85](#Mine-HOSC06)].
