    dynamic run-time environment (which is represented by our substitution cache).
    This is *almost always* undesirable, as I hope to convince you.

    artifacts of this were (sort-of) dismissed as an implementation bug. When Scheme
    was introduced, it was the first Lisp dialect that used strictly lexical scoping,
    and Racket is obviously doing the same. (Some Lisp implementations used dynamic
    scope for interpreted code and lexical scope for compiled code!) In fact, Emacs
    Lisp is the only *live* dialects of Lisp that is still dynamically scoped by default.
    Too see this, compare a version of the above code in Racket:'

- en: 'There are some cases where dynamic scope can be useful in that it allows you
    to “remotely” customize any piece of code. A good example of where this is taken
    to an extreme is Emacs: originally, it was based on an ancient Lisp dialect that
    was still dynamically scoped, but it retained this feature even when practically
    all Lisp dialects moved on to having lexical scope by default. The reason for
    this is that the danger of dynamic scope is also a way to make a very open system
    where almost anything can be customized by changing it “remotely”. Here’s a concrete
    example for a similar kind of dynamic scope usage that makes a very hackable and
    open system:'

  zh: 有一些情况下，动态作用域可能会很有用，因为它允许你“远程”定制任何代码片段。一个典型的例子就是 Emacs：最初，它是基于一种古老的 Lisp 方言，该方言仍然具有动态作用域，但即使几乎所有的
    Lisp 方言都默认采用词法作用域，Emacs 仍保留了这一特性。原因是动态作用域的危险也是使系统非常开放的一种方式，几乎任何东西都可以通过“远程”更改来定制。下面是一个类似动态作用域用法的具体示例，它使系统非常易于修改和开放：

- en: 'Obviously, this power to customize everything is also the main source of problems
    with getting no guarantees for code. A common way to get the best of both worlds
    is to have *controllable* dynamic scope. For example, Common Lisp also has lexical
    scope everywhere by default, but some variables can be declared as *special*,
    which means that they are dynamically scoped. The main problem with that is that
    you can’t tell when a variable is special by just looking at the code that uses
    it, so a more popular approach is the one that is used in Racket: all bindings
    are always lexically scoped, but there are *parameters* which are a kind of dynamically
    scoped value containers — but they are bound to plain (lexically scoped) identifiers.
    Here’s the same code as above, translated to Racket with parameters:'

  zh: 显然，这种定制一切的能力也是代码没有任何保证的主要问题的根源。在这两种世界中找到最佳解决方案的常见方法是拥有*可控*的动态作用域。例如，Common Lisp
    默认情况下在所有地方都具有词法作用域，但一些变量可以声明为*special*，这意味着它们是动态作用域的。主要问题在于，你无法通过查看使用它的代码来确定变量是否是
    special，因此更流行的方法是 Racket 中使用的方法：所有绑定始终具有词法作用域，但有*parameters*，它们是一种动态作用域的值容器 ——
    但它们绑定到纯粹（词法作用域）的标识符上。下面是将上述代码翻译为 Racket 并使用参数的相同代码：
- en: '[PRE11]'
  id: totrans-33
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_PRE
  zh: '[PRE11]'
- en: The main point here is that the points where a dynamically scoped value is used
    are under the programmer’s control — you cannot “customize” what `-` is doing,
    for example. This gives us back the guarantees that we like to have (= that code
    works), but of course these points are pre-determined, unlike an environment where
    everything can be customized including things that are unexpectedly useful.
  id: totrans-34

  zh: 这里的主要观点是动态作用域值被使用的地方在程序员的控制之下 —— 例如，你无法“定制” `-` 在做什么。这给了我们我们喜欢拥有的保证（= 代码能够正常工作），但当然这些点是预先确定的，不像一个可以定制一切的环境，包括那些意外有用的东西。
- en: As a side-note, after many decades of debating this, Emacs has finally added
    lexical scope in its core language, but this is still determined by a flag — a
    global `lexical-binding` variable.

  - PREF_BQ
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 顺带一提，在经过几十年的辩论之后，Emacs 最终在其核心语言中添加了词法作用域，但这仍然由一个标志来确定 —— 一个全局的 `lexical-binding`
    变量。
