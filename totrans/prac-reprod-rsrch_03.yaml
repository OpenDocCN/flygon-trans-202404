    a high school or an undergraduate chemistry or biology lab. Imagine sitting down
    on the first day, in a new room, surrounded by new classmates, in front of a new
    teacher, and encountering all of the strange sights and smells around you. Perhaps
    there were jars containing strange substances along the walls, oddly shaped glass
    and metal equipment, and safety gear to protect you from some mysterious danger.

  zh: 回想一下你所参加过的第一个实验室科学课程，也许是高中或本科的化学或生物学实验室。想象一下，第一天坐下来时，你在一个新的房间里，被新的同学包围着，在一个新的老师面前，遇到你周围的所有奇怪的景象和气味。也许墙上有装着奇怪物质的罐子，奇形怪状的玻璃和金属器材，以及用于保护你免受某种神秘危险的安全装备。
- en: As you entered this new physical and intellectual environment, preparing to
    learn the foundational knowledge and skills of a new field of science, what was
    the first thing that you were taught? Whatever it was, we suspect that it was
    *not* chemistry or biology. For most of us, the first instructions in a lab course
    were about how to perform basic tasks like cleaning the equipment, zeroing a balance,
    labeling a beaker, and recording every step that you performed in a lab notebook.

  zh: 当你进入这个新的物理和智力环境，准备学习一个新科学领域的基础知识和技能时，你被教的第一件事是什么？无论它是什么，我们怀疑它不是化学或生物学。对于我们大多数人来说，在实验课上的第一个指令是关于如何执行基本任务，比如清洁设备、校准天平、标记烧瓶，并在实验笔记本中记录你所执行的每一步。
- en: What did all of these seemingly menial tasks have to do with the science that
    you were supposed to be learning? Although it may not have been clear right away,
    these steps were all designed to ensure that, when you did conduct an experiment,
    you would be confident in the accuracy of your results and be able to clearly
    communicate what you did to someone else. Together, these two factors would permit
    someone else to perform the same experiment and achieve the same result, verifying
    your findings. None of your actual experimental results would have been meaningful,
    or useful to others, had you not followed these basic procedures and principles.

  zh: 所有这些看似琐碎的任务与你应该学习的科学有什么关系呢？虽然一开始可能不清楚，但这些步骤都是为了确保当你进行实验时，你能够对结果的准确性充满信心，并能清晰地向他人传达你所做的事情。这两个因素共同作用，使得他人能够执行相同的实验并得到相同的结果，验证你的发现。如果你没有遵循这些基本程序和原则，那么你的实验结果对他人来说将毫无意义，或者对他人没有用处。
- en: Now jump forward again to the present, and consider the type of research work
    that you do today. Almost certainly, you are using methods, tools, and equipment
    that are significantly more complex than those that you encountered in your first
    lab course. If you are like most scientists today, your research is also slowly,
    or not so slowly, shifting away from the traditional "lab bench" of your discipline
    and into the rapidly expanding world of scientific computing. There is scarcely
    a scientific discipline today that is not being rapidly transformed by an infusion
    of new hardware, software, programming languages, messy data sets, and complex
    new methods for data analysis.

  zh: 现在再次跳到现在，并考虑一下你今天所做的研究工作的类型。几乎可以肯定，你正在使用的方法、工具和设备要比你在第一个实验课上遇到的要复杂得多。如果你像今天的大多数科学家一样，你的研究也在慢慢地，或者说不那么慢地，从你学科的传统“实验台”转向了科学计算的迅速扩展世界。今天几乎没有一个科学学科不被新的硬件、软件、编程语言、杂乱的数据集和复杂的数据分析方法的注入所快速改变。
- en: Unfortunately, however, many excellent and accomplished scientists never received
    even high school or undergraduate-level training in basic scientific computing
    skills. Many of us struggle along as best we can, trying to write code, work with
    uncomfortably large data sets, make correctly formatted figures, write and edit
    papers with collaborators, and somehow not lose track of which data and which
    analysis led to what result along the way. These are difficult tasks for someone
    well-versed in scientific computing, much less for scientists who are trying to
    pick up these skills on the fly from colleagues, books, and workshops.

  zh: 在科学计算实践领域中，本书探讨的技术支持的目标是*计算再现性*。对于本书的目的，我们将计算再现性定义如下：
- en: '**A research project is computationally reproducible if a second investigator
    (including you in the future) can recreate the final reported results of the project,
    including key quantitative findings, tables, and figures, given only a set of
    files and written instructions.**'

    a notebook, a stack of equipment, and some raw materials to a classmate and asking
    them to arrive at the same result that you did.

  zh: 回想起那节实验课，这相当于将一本笔记本、一堆设备和一些原材料交给一位同学，并要求他们得出与你相同的结果。
- en: There are many reasons why we believe that that practicing computational reproducibility
    is perhaps the key foundational skill for scientific computing. Perhaps most importantly,
    working towards computational reproducibility will indirectly require you to follow
    many general scientific best practices for all of your digital analyses, including
    recording all steps in your research process, linking a final result back to the
    initial data and other inputs that generated it, and making all necessary data
    and inputs available to your colleagues.

  zh: 我们有许多理由相信，实践计算再现性可能是科学计算的关键基础技能。也许最重要的是，努力实现计算再现性将间接要求您遵循所有数字分析的一般科学最佳实践，包括记录研究过程中的所有步骤，将最终结果与生成它的初始数据和其他输入进行关联，并向同事提供所有必要的数据和输入。
- en: Additionally, thinking explicitly about computational reproducibility helps
    to move the focus of research up a level from individual activities to the entire
    scientific workflow. This change in perspective is becoming increasingly important
    as our work becomes so complex that the overarching grand perspective is not always
    obvious.

  zh: 此外，明确思考计算再现性有助于将研究重点从个体活动转移到整个科学工作流程。随着我们的工作变得如此复杂，以至于总体的宏观视角并不总是显而易见，这种视角的转变变得越来越重要。
- en: Finally, the computational reproducibility of an individual research project
    can often be substantially increased or decreased by an individual investigator,
    meaning that the skills that we will discuss in this book can immediately be put
    into practice in nearly all types of research projects. This level of control
    contrasts, for example, with more complex issues such as scienitific replicability
    (see Chapter 2), which are more heavily dependent on coordination among many scientists
    or on institutional actions.

  zh: 最后，个人研究项目的计算再现性往往可以通过个人研究者大幅增加或减少，这意味着我们将在本书中讨论的技能几乎可以立即应用于几乎所有类型的研究项目。这种控制水平与更复杂的问题形成对比，例如科学可复制性（见第2章），后者更大程度上依赖于许多科学家之间的协调或机构行动。
- en: This book is designed to demonstrate and teach how many of today's scientists
    are striving to make their research more computationally reproducible. The research
    described in this volume spans many traditional academic disciplines, but all
    of it falls into what may be called the data-intensive sciences. We define these
    fields as those in which researchers are routinely expected to collect, manipulate,
    and analyze large, heterogeneous, uncertain data sets, tasks that generally require
    some amount of programming and software development. While there are many challenges
    to achieving reproducibility in other fields that rely on fundamentally different
    research methods, including the social sciences and humanities, these approaches
    are not covered here.

    workflow, key tools and techniques, and major challenges. The authors include
    both junior and senior scholars, ranging from graduate students to full professors.

    the extent to which a research project is computationally reproducible. In Chapter
    3, *The Basic Reproducible Workflow Template*, Kitzes provides a step-by-step

    a standalone first lesson for beginners and as a means of framing the subsequent
