    fields produced by the polarization and physicists describe these things by defining
    two kinds of electric fields, **D** and **E** and two kinds of magnetic fields,
    **B** and **H** one of which is the field produced by the actual charge distribution,
    and the other the field including the effects of polarization in matter as well.
