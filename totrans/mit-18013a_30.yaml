    unless the electrons have charge density that is independent of time.

  zh: 如果它们这样做了，作为带电粒子，它们会产生电磁波，这些波将带走能量。如果能量守恒，轨道就无法稳定，除非电子具有独立于时间的电荷密度。
- en: Replacing classical mechanics by a formulation that allows electrons to have
    time independent charge distributions was one of the main triumphs of early 20^(th)
    Century physics.
