    extend it with more arithmetic operations that can nevertheless be expressed in
    terms of existing ones. We’ll add just two, because these will suffice to illustrate
    the point.

    and multiplication, it’s easy to define subtraction: \(a - b = a + -1 \times b\).'

    so, we face a decision: where does this new subtraction operator reside? It is
    tempting, and perhaps seems natural, to just add one more rule to our existing
    ArithC datatype.'

  prefs:
  - PREF_BQ
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This creates a few problems. The first, obvious, one is that we now have to
    modify all programs that process ArithC. So far that’s only our interpreter, which
    is pretty simple, but in a more complex implementation, that could already be
    a concern. Second, we were trying to add new constructs that we can define in
    terms of existing ones; it feels slightly self-defeating to do this in a way that
    isn’t modular. Third, and most subtly, there’s something conceptually wrong about
    modifying ArithC. That’s because ArithC represents our core language. In contrast,
    subtraction and other additions represent our user-facing, surface language. It’s
    wise to record conceptually different ideas in distinct datatypes, rather than
    shoehorn them into one. The separation can look a little unwieldy sometimes, but
    it makes the program much easier for future developers to read and maintain. Besides,
    for different purposes you might want to layer on different extensions, and separating
    the core from the surface enables that.

    to also parse - expressions, and always construct ArithS terms (rather than any
    ArithC ones). Second, we should implement a desugar function that translates ArithS
    values into ArithC ones.

    it directly in the generated term. This embedding of an input term in another

    recursion the sub-problem is a computed function of the input, rather than a structural
    piece of it. This is an especially simple case of generative recursion, because
    the “function” is simple: it’s just the bminusS constructor. We might be tempted

    if its meaning changes, so will that of uminusS, even if we don’t want it to.
    In contrast, defining a functional abstraction that consumes two terms and generates
    one representing the addition of the first to -1 times the second, and using this
    to define the desugaring of both uminusS and bminusS, is a little more fault-tolerant.

- en: You might say that the meaning of subtraction is never going to change, so why
    bother? Yes and no. Yes, it’s meaning is unlikely to change; but no, its implementation
    might. For instance, the developer may decide to log all uses of binary subtraction.
    In the macro expansion, all uses of unary negation would also get logged, but
    they would not in the second expansion.
  prefs:
  - PREF_IND
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Fortunately, in this particular case we have a much simpler option, which is
    to define \(-b = -1 \times b\). This expansion works with the primitives we have,
    and follows structural recursion. The reason we took the above detour, however,
    is to alert you to these problems, and warn that you might not always be so fortunate.
