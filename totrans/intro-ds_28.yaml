- en: 'Support Vector Machine can also be used as a regression method, maintaining
    all the main features that characterize the algorithm (maximal margin). The Support
    Vector Regression (SVR) uses the same principles as the SVM for classification,
    with only a few minor differences. First of all, because output is a real number
    it becomes very difficult to predict the information at hand, which has infinite
    possibilities. In the case of regression, a margin of tolerance (epsilon) is set
    in approximation to the SVM which would have already requested from the problem.
    But besides this fact, there is also a more complicated reason, the algorithm
    is more complicated therefore to be taken in consideration. However, the main
    idea is always the same: to minimize error, individualizing the hyperplane which
    maximizes the margin, keeping in mind that part of the error is tolerated.'
