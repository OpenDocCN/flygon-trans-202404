- en: Paul Lee, username leep, more commonly known as Hoppy, had a reputation as the
    local expert on programming issues. I needed help. I walked across to Hoppy's
    desk and asked, could he take a look at some code for me?

  zh: 保罗·李，用户名 leep，更为人熟知的是 Hoppy，以其对编程问题的专业知识而闻名于当地。我需要帮助。我走到 Hoppy 的办公桌前，问道，他能否帮我看一下一些代码？
- en: Sure, said Hoppy, pull up a chair. I took care not to topple the empty cola
    cans stacked in a pyramid behind him.

- en: So let's take a look at this function. Hoppy moved aside a copy of K&R and slid
    his keyboard in front of me.

  zh: 那么让我们看看这个函数。Hoppy 把 K&R 的副本放到一边，把键盘放到了我面前。
- en: Where's the IDE? Apparently Hoppy had no IDE running, just some editor which
    I couldn't operate. He grabbed back the keyboard. A few keystrokes later and we
    had the file open — it was quite a big file — and were looking at the function
    — it was quite a big function. He paged down to the conditional block I wanted
    to ask about.

  zh: 集成开发环境在哪里？显然，Hoppy 没有运行 IDE，只有一些我无法操作的编辑器。他抢回了键盘。几次按键之后，我们打开了文件 —— 那是一个相当大的文件
    —— 并且正在查看函数 —— 那是一个相当大的函数。他翻到了我想问的条件块。

    wrong.

  zh: 如果 `x` 是负数，这个从句实际上会做什么呢？我问道。这肯定是错的。
- en: I'd been trying all morning to find a way to force `x` to be negative, but the
    big function in the big file was part of a big project, and the cycle of recompiling
    *then* rerunning my experiments was wearing me down. Couldn't an expert like Hoppy
    just tell me the answer?

  zh: 早上我一直在努力寻找一种方法来强制 `x` 为负数，但是大文件中的大函数是一个大项目的一部分，反复编译*然后*重新运行我的实验已经让我筋疲力尽。像 Hoppy
    这样的专家难道不能告诉我答案吗？
- en: 'Hoppy admitted he wasn''t sure. To my surprise, he didn''t reach for K&R. Instead,
    he copied the code block into a new editor buffer, re-indented it, wrapped it
    up in a function. A short while later he''d coded up a main function that looped
    forever, prompting the user for input values, passing them to the function, printing
    out the result. He saved the buffer as a new file, tryit.c. All of this I could
    have done for myself, though perhaps not as quickly. But his next step was wonderfully
    simple and, at the time, quite foreign to my way of working:'

  zh: Hoppy 承认他不确定。令我惊讶的是，他没有翻 K&R。相反，他把代码块复制到一个新的编辑器缓冲区中，重新缩进，包装成一个函数。不久之后，他编写了一个永远循环的主函数，提示用户输入值，将它们传递给函数，然后打印出结果。他将缓冲区保存为一个新文件，tryit.c。所有这些我也可以做到，尽管可能不会那么快。但他的下一步非常简单，而且当时对我的工作方式来说相当陌生：

- en: Look! His actual program, conceived just a few minutes earlier, was now up and
    running. We tried a few values and confirmed my suspicions (so I'd been right
    about something!) and then he cross-checked the relevant section of K&R. I thanked
    Hoppy and left, again taking care not to disturb his cola can pyramid.

  zh: 看！他刚刚几分钟前构思出的实际程序现在已经运行起来了。我们尝试了一些值，并确认了我的猜想（所以我关于某事是正确的！），然后他又检查了 K&R 的相关部分。我感谢
    Hoppy 并离开了，再次小心翼翼地不要打扰他的可乐罐金字塔。
- en: Back at my own desk, I closed down my IDE. I'd become so used to working on
    a big project within a big product I'd started to think that was what I should
    be doing. A general purpose computer can do little tasks too. I opened a text
    editor and began typing.

  zh: 回到自己的桌子前，我关闭了我的集成开发环境。我已经习惯了在一个大项目中工作，开始觉得那才是我应该做的。通用计算机也可以做一些小任务。我打开了一个文本编辑器，开始打字。
