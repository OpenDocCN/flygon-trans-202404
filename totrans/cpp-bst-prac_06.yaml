- en: Most portability issues that generate warnings are because we are not careful
    about our types. Standard library and arrays are indexed with `size_t`. Standard
    container sizes are reported in `size_t`. If you get the handling of `size_t`
    wrong, you can create subtle lurking 64-bit issues that arise only after you start
    to overflow the indexing of 32-bit integers. char vs unsigned char.
