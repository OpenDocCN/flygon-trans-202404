    am I performing this task?" and your answer is "To complete the task," then you're
    not doing deliberate practice.

- en: You do deliberate practice to improve your ability to perform a task. It's about
    skill and technique. Deliberate practice means repetition. It means performing
    the task with the aim of increasing your mastery of one or more aspects of the
    task. It means repeating the repetition. Slowly, over and over again. Until you
    achieve your desired level of mastery. You do deliberate practice to master the
    task not to complete the task.

    aim of deliberate practice is to improve your performance. They are not the same.
    Ask yourself, how much of your time do you spend developing someone else's product?
    How much developing yourself?

    elite performers a minimum of 10,000 hours of deliberate focused practice to become
    experts."

    hour! Nevertheless, 10,000 hours is a lot: about 20 hours per week for 10 years.
    Given this level of commitment you might be worrying that you''re just not expert
    material. You are. Greatness is largely a matter of conscious choice. *Your choice.*
    Research over the last two decades has shown the main factor in acquiring expertise
    is time spent doing deliberate practice. Innate ability is *not* the main factor.'

    inborn talent does not account for much more than a threshold; you have to have
    a minimum amount of natural ability to get started in a sport or profession. After
    that, the people who excel are the ones who work the hardest."'

    doing it again and again, but challenging yourself with a task that is just beyond
    your current ability, trying it, analyzing your performance while and after doing
    it, and correcting any mistakes."'

    that changes your behavior. Good luck.
