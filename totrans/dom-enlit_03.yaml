- en: The enlightenment series ([jQuery Enlightenment](http://jqueryenlightenment.com/)
    & [JavaScript Enlightenment](http://javascriptenlightenment.com/)) is written
    in a style that favors small, isolated, immediately executable code over wordy
    explanations and monolithic programs. One of my favorite authors, C.S Lewis, asserts
    that words are the lowest form of communication that humans traffic in. I totally
    agree with this assertion and use it as the basis for the style of these books.
    I feel that technical information is best covered with as few words as possible,
    in conjunction with just the right amount of executable code and commenting required
    to express an idea. The style of this book attempts to present a clearly defined
    idea with as few words as possible, backed with real code. Because of this, when
    you first start grokking these concepts, you should execute and examine the code,
    thereby forming the foundation of a mental model for the words used to describe
    the concepts. Additionally, the format of these books attempts to systematically
    break ideas down into their smallest possible form and examine each one in an
    isolated context. All this to say that this is not a book with lengthy explanations
    or in-depth coverage on broad topics. Consider yourself warned. If it helps, think
    of it as a cookbook, but even more terse and to the point than usual.

    directly relevant to the concept being discussed. Any additional code used to
    support the orange colored code will be green. The color gray in the code examples
    is reserved for comments.

    page, where the code can be tweaked and executed online. The jsFiddle examples
    have been configured to use the [Firebug lite-dev plugin](https://getfirebug.com/firebug-lite-debug.js)
    to ensure the reader views the console.log prevalent in this book. Before reading
    this book, make sure you are comfortable with the usage and purpose of *console.log*.
