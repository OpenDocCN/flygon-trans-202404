- en: A numerical or continuous variable (attribute) is one that may take on any value
    within a finite or infinite interval (e.g., height, weight, temperature, blood
    glucose, ...). There are two types of numerical variables, **interval** and **ratio**.
    An interval variable has values whose differences are interpretable, but it does
    not have a true zero. A good example is temperature in Centigrade degrees. Data
    on an interval scale can be added and subtracted but cannot be meaningfully multiplied
    or divided. For example, we cannot say that one day is twice as hot as another
    day. In contrast, a ratio variable has values with a true zero and can be added,
    subtracted, multiplied or divided (e.g., weight).
