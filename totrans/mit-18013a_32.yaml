    them. However it is a good idea to develop some experience in doing so, to build
    your confidence in them. One of these is generally done by your performing a multiple
    integration, which means a sequence of ordinary integrations. To do so you must
    do three things: determine the integrand as a function of your variables of integration;
    determine the area or volume element of the integral in terms of same; and find
    appropriate limits of integration on the ordinary integrals obtained. Once this
    is done you then perform ordinary integrations. We discuss these steps here.'

    integrand and the right set of differentials, you are ready to start integrating.
    You are then on your own.

- en: '**Exercise 31.8** **Determine the moments of inertia of bodies with the shape
    of the cone and ellipsoid above about the z-axis. Assume that the mass densities
    are constant throughout the bodies. (The moment of inertia of a body is the integral
    of its density multiplied by the square of the distance of the volume element
    to the z-axis. However, it is always expressed as a function not of the density,
    but of the mass of the body. You must therefore take the ratio of the integral
    determining the moment of inertia, and that determining the mass to get the relation
    between the two.)**'
