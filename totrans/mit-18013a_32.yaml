    them. However it is a good idea to develop some experience in doing so, to build
    your confidence in them. One of these is generally done by your performing a multiple
    integration, which means a sequence of ordinary integrations. To do so you must
    do three things: determine the integrand as a function of your variables of integration;
    determine the area or volume element of the integral in terms of same; and find
    appropriate limits of integration on the ordinary integrals obtained. Once this
    is done you then perform ordinary integrations. We discuss these steps here.'
