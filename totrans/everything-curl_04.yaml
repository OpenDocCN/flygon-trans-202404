- en: The curl and libcurl source code have been carefully written to build and run
    on virtually every computer platform in existence. This can only be done through
    hard work and by adhering to a few guidelines (and, of course, a fair amount of
    testing).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    then have the setup scripts (configure or CMake or hard-coded) check for the presence
    of said features in a user''s computer setup before the program is compiled there.
    Additionally and as a bonus, thanks to this way of writing the code, some features
    can be explicitly turned off even if they are present in the system and *could*
    be used. Examples of that would be when users want to, for example, build a version
    of the library with a smaller footprint or with support for certain protocols
    disabled, etc.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'The project sometimes uses #ifdef protection around entire source files when,
    for example, a single file is provided for a specific operating system or perhaps
    for a specific feature that isn''t always present. This is to make it possible
    for all platforms to always build all files—it simplifies the build scripts and
    makefiles a lot. A file entirely #ifdefed out hardly adds anything to the build
    time, anyway.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    code base. Easy-to-read is a very important property of code and helps make it
    easier to review when new things are added and it helps debugging code when developers

    than individual contributors having their own personal tastes satisfied.
