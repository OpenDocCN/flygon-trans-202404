- en: At this point, you should be very familiar with programming principles in Scheme
    and Racket. Time to transfer this knowledge into a new language! Enter Python.
    This is a bit more detailed than the intro to Python in your project 4 spec but
    still pretty basic. Doing one should make the other a breeze. Enjoy!

    to Python 2\. You can skip the following if you have already installed Python
    3\. When you launch python in your terminal, the version you have installed is
    displayed so check there.

- en: Anaconda is a distribution of Python that packages together Python with some
    other useful libraries such as [NumPy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NumPy). Anaconda
    also makes it much easier to install more extensions and automatically adds python
    to your computer’s path variable.

- en: If you have Python 3 installed correctly, you should be able to launch it via
    your terminal with the command `python`. You should see three carrots `>>>` that
    indicate that the python interpreter is accepting input! If you're having problems,
    please check that you've set up your path environment variable to point to your
    installation (if you're not sure what that means, try google!) and make sure that
    you remove any other paths to older python versions. If you're on a mac, see [this](http://superuser.com/questions/770696/how-to-update-macs-system-python).

    “python” followed by the file path and the “-i” flag to load the file and run
    python interactively. If you are missing the -i flag, the python load the file,
    run it, and exit
