    package](modeler_example1.zip). It's pretty much the same such package that I
    will be using for Chalktalk.

- en: I wrote this package not to be complete and comprehensive, but to be easy to
    understand. You should feel free, if you are feeling particularly intrepid or
    inspired, to make changes, additions or other customizations to it.

- en: Between now and the rest of the semester you will be working with this package
    to "do your own thing". For example, you might want to write your own customized
    vertex and fragment shaders, or create complex organic shapes by using your own
    spline package, or create hierarchical mechanisms, such as a mechanical clock
    or automobile engine or wind-up toy. You might want to try to create animated
    characters, whether human-like or fancifal creatures, or entire architectural
    environments. There are many directions you can go.

    to show what you are building, and to get feedback in class from me and from other
    students. I very strongly encourage you to make use of this opportunity.
