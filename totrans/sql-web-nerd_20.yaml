- en: Consider John Q. Nerd with his bona fide SQL expertise and MIT PhD. How much
    useful work can John get out of Oracle? None. John Q. Nerd only knows how to drive
    Oracle from SQL*Plus. This appendix covers the little details such as getting
    data into or out of Oracle. It is organized as an FAQ.

    hair, go with Perl DBD/DBI (a module available from [http://www.cpan.org](http://www.cpan.org);

    GUI tool such as Data Junction ([http://www.datajunction.com](http://www.datajunction.com)).
    These are PC-based applications that open simultaneous connections to your Oracle
    database and some other RDBMS. They can generally show you what''s available in
    the other database and drag whatever you think necessary into Oracle.'

    Server Utilities manual about `exp` and `imp` ([http://www.oradoc.com/keyword/export_import](http://www.oradoc.com/keyword/export_import)).'

    mailer to fork a Perl DBD/DBI script that will then parse out the content from
    the headers and other such crud, open up Oracle, and then send an insert statement.
    Due to the fork and the opening of Oracle, this is 1/100th the efficiency of a
    Web script running in a threaded Web server with database connection pooling.
    However, you probably won''t be getting 40 email messages per second so it doesn''t
    really matter. The old open-source ArsDigita Community System includes a Perl
    script that you could use as a starting point. See [http://philip.greenspun.com/ancient-history/software/acs-3.4.10.tar.tgz](/ancient-history/software/acs-3.4.10.tar.tgz)
