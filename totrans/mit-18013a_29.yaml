    Century. Electrically charged objects were produced by rubbing one substance with
    another. Two kinds of charge were observed, like charges repel one another, and
    unlike charges attract.

    which led Priestley and Cavendish to try to prove that the electric force was
    an inverse square force just like the gravitational force. Coulomb proved by his
    experiments that the force between two unlike charges is indeed inverse to the
    square of their distance apart, and along the line joining them. The attraction
    has exactly the form of gravitational attraction between masses.

    notion of an electric field. This is defined as the force per unit charge that
    a small fictitious charged object would experience from a given distribution of
    charges when placed at the argument of the field.

    electric field of a point charge is inversely proportional to that same quantity.
    Therefore the integral of the normal component of an electric field around a spherical
    surface is independent of the radius of the sphere, and only measures the strength
    of the charge at its center.

    became practical for people to produce currents of electricity. Oersted and Ampere
    discovered in about 1820 that electric currents produce forces that cause magnetized
    needles to line up in a direction **tangential to a circle about** the wire. Ampere,
    in particular, discovered that the magnetic force on such needles produced by
    a long straight wire carrying electric current is proportional to the current
    flow and **inversely proportional to the distance of the needle from the wire.**

    constant times the "flux" or flow of current through the wire for any such circle.

    then there should be some sort of reciprocity: magnetic flux ought to be able
    to cause electric current circulation. In 1831, after looking for such an effect,
    he discovered his celebrated law of induction: that **changing magnetic flux through
    a surface S produces a circulation of electric field on its boundary.** This means
    it produces a "difference in electrical potential" around the boundary path of
    S which means a charged particle in a wire around it will have work done on it
    in moving around the wire. This will make electric current flow in a wire around
    the surface, and that current is a constant times the **derivative** of the magnetic
    flux through (any) surface bounded by the wire.'

    charge builds up across the gap, and this current will produce a magnetic field
    of its own. If the current in both wires is made to oscillate, that is, to flow
    back and forth as a sine function of time, current will flow much of the time
    despite the gap, and if the frequency of the sine is large enough, there will
    be little charge build up at the gap at any time, and little "impedance" to current
    flow in the wire.

    there will be oscillating "magnetic circulation" around the wire, from the oscillating
    current flow in the wire in this situation. **But if we take a surface that passes
    through the wire and deform it to make it pass through the gap instead of the

    no magnetic circulation on the same path in contradiction to the previous statement.**

    the wire or else by distorting that surface keeping its boundary the same, into
    one that goes only goes through the gap. The integral of flux of a curl must be
    the same for both surfaces. There must therefore be something in the gap that,
    like current, contributes to the flux of the curl of the magnetic field there.

    we pass our surface through the wire or through the gap. The flux of the curl
    of the magnetic field must be the same in both. If the curl of the magnetic field
    is to be flux of current in the wire it must be something else in the gap and
    that something else must have the same flux.

    field caused by the charge oscillations on its faces. Maxwell postulated that

    in the resulting equations. When written as differential equations, the laws of
    Gauss, Ampere with Maxwell's modification, and Faraday have the consequence that
    electric and magnetic fields obey "the wave equation" in the absence of matter,
    and suggest that there can be waves of electric and magnetic field, which waves
    move with a finite velocity.
