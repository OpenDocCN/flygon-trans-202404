["```\nEnforcing access through well defined object relations and interfaces is\nrecommended for models beyond the most trivial cases. \n```", "```\nThis is more of a Human Interface design question, but the choice can influence the\ndesign choices at the level of Model and View. It also depends on the data. Individual\nvalues that are incorrect can be marked in red. Typically, the user would input some data.\nthe value would be checked for validity, and if found invalid, the View would be changed\nto express this information. This case probably enjoys using a Local Model, so that changes\ncan be discarded and the original Model is left untouched. It also means that the Model\nmust be able to accept and preserve invalid data, because this invalid data\nmay be a step stone to reach a correct state after additional modifications. \n```"]
