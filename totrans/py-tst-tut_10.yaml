    his leg. So the captain set sail for a hunt. For months he was searching the sea
    for the white whale. The captain finally attacked the whale with a harpoon. Unimpressed,
    the whale devoured captain, crew and ship. The whale won.*'

    of a whaling ship and a whale. In the book, the whale wins by eating most of the
    other characters.
