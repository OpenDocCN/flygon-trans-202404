- en: '[Cody Lindley](http://www.codylindley.com) is a client-side engineer (aka front-end
    developer) and recovering Flash developer. He has an extensive background working
    professionally (11+ years) with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Flash, and client-side
    performance techniques as it pertains to web development. If he is not wielding
    client-side code he is likely toying with interface/interaction design or authoring
    material and speaking at various conferences. When not sitting in front of a computer,
    it is a sure bet he is hanging out with his wife and kids in Boise, Idaho â€“ training
    for triathlons, skiing, mountain biking, road biking, alpine climbing, reading,
    watching movies, or debating the rational evidence for a Christian worldview.'
