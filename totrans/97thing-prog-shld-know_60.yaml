- en: Whether they call themselves *Quality Assurance* or *Quality Control*, many
    programmers call them *Trouble*. In my experience, programmers often have an adversarial
    relationship with the people who test their software. "They're too picky" and
    "They want everything perfect" are common complaints. Sound familiar?

  zh: 无论他们自称为*质量保证*还是*质量控制*，许多程序员都称他们为*麻烦*。根据我的经验，程序员经常与测试他们软件的人产生对抗性关系。“他们太挑剔”和“他们想要一切完美”是常见的抱怨。听起来熟悉吗？
- en: I'm not sure why, but I've always had a different view of testers. Maybe it's
    because the "tester" at my first job was the company secretary. Margaret was a
    very nice lady who kept the office running, and tried to teach a couple of young
    programmers how to behave professionally in front of customers. She also had a
    gift for finding any bug, no matter how obscure, in mere moments.

  zh: 我不确定为什么，但我一直对测试人员有不同的看法。也许是因为我第一份工作中的“测试人员”是公司秘书。玛格丽特是一个非常友善的女士，她让办公室运转良好，并试图教两个年轻的程序员如何在客户面前表现专业。她还有一种天赋，能在短短几分钟内找到任何bug，无论多么隐蔽。
- en: Back then I was working on a program written by an accountant who thought he
    was a programmer. Needless to say, it had some serious problems. When I thought
    I had a piece straightened out, Margaret would try to use it and, more often than
    not, it would fail in some new way after just a few keystrokes. It was at times
    frustrating and embarrassing, but she was such a pleasant person that I never
    thought to blame her for making me look bad. Eventually the day came when Margaret
    was able to cleanly start the program, enter an invoice, print it, and shut it
    down. I was thrilled. Even better, when we installed it on our customer's machine
    it all worked. They never saw any problems because Margaret had helped me find
    and fix them first.

  zh: 那时我正在处理一个由一位认为自己是程序员的会计编写的程序。不用说，它有一些严重的问题。当我认为我已经解决了一个问题时，玛格丽特会尝试使用它，往往在敲击几下键后以一种新的方式失败。有时令人沮丧和尴尬，但她是一个如此愉快的人，以至于我从未想过责怪她让我难堪。最终的一天到来了，玛格丽特能够干净地启动程序，输入发票，打印它，并关闭它。我很激动。更好的是，当我们将其安装在我们客户的机器上时，一切都正常。他们从未看到任何问题，因为玛格丽特帮助我先找到并修复了它们。
- en: So that's why I say testers are your friends. You may think the testers make
    you look bad by reporting trivial issues. But when customers are thrilled because
    they weren't bothered by all those "little things" that QC made you fix, then
    you look great. See what I mean?

  zh: 所以我说测试人员是你的朋友。你可能认为测试人员通过报告琐碎问题让你难堪。但当客户因为他们不受QC让你修复的所有那些“小事”的困扰而感到高兴时，你看起来很棒。明白我的意思��？
- en: 'Imagine this: You''re test-driving a utility that uses "ground-breaking artificial
    intelligence algorithms" to find and fix concurrency problems. You fire it up
    and immediately notice they misspelled "intelligence" on the splash screen. A
    little inauspicious, but it''s just a typo, right? Then you notice the configuration
    screen uses check boxes where there should be radio buttons, and some of the keyboard
    shortcuts don''t work. Now, none of these is a big deal, but as the errors add
    up you begin to wonder about the programmers. If they can''t get the simple things
    right, what are the odds their AI can really find and fix something tricky like
    concurrency issues?'

  zh: 想象一下：你正在试用一款利用“开创性的人工智能算法”来查找和修复并发问题的实用程序。你启动它，立即注意到他们在启动画面上拼错了“intelligence”。有点不吉利，但这只是一个拼写错误，对吧？然后你注意到配置屏幕使用了复选框，而应该是单选按钮，并且一些键盘快捷键不起作用。现在，这些都不是什么大问题，但随着错误的累积，你开始怀疑程序员们。如果他们连简单的事情都做不对，那么他们的人工智能真的能找到并修复像并发问题这样棘手的东西吗？
- en: They could be geniuses who were so focused on making the AI insanely great that
    they didn't notice those trivial things. And without "picky testers" pointing
    out the problems, you wound up finding them. And now you're questioning the competency
    of the programmers.

  zh: 他们可能是那些专注于使人工智能变得非常出色而没有注意到那些琐碎事情的天才。没有“挑剔的测试人员”指出问题，你最终找到了它们。现在你开始质疑程序员的能力。
- en: So as strange as it may sound, those testers who seem determined to expose every
    little bug in your code really are your friends.
