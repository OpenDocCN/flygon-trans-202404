- en: ASP.NET Core is a web framework created by Microsoft for building web applications,
    APIs, and microservices. It uses common patterns like MVC (Model-View-Controller),
    dependency injection, and a request pipeline comprised of middleware. It's open-source
    under the Apache 2.0 license, which means the source code is freely available,
    and the community is encouraged to contribute bug fixes and new features.

- en: ASP.NET Core runs on top of Microsoft's .NET runtime, similar to the Java Virtual
    Machine (JVM) or the Ruby interpreter. You can write ASP.NET Core applications
    in a number of languages (C#, Visual Basic, F#). C# is the most popular choice,
    and it's what I'll use in this book. You can build and run ASP.NET Core applications
    on Windows, Mac, and Linux.

    have to. You also get the benefit of static typing with the .NET compiler, which

- en: '**.NET Standard** is a platform-agnostic interface that defines what features
    and APIs are available in .NET. .NET Standard doesn''t represent any actual code
    or functionality, just the API definition. There are different "versions" or levels
    of .NET Standard that reflect how many APIs are available (or how wide the API
    surface area is). For example, .NET Standard 2.0 has more APIs available than
    .NET Standard 1.5, which has more APIs than .NET Standard 1.0.'

    appropriate platform-specific code on each operating system. This is what you''ll
    install on your own machine to build and run ASP.NET Core applications.'
  id: totrans-35

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And just for good measure, **.NET Framework** is a different implementation
    of .NET Standard that is Windows-only. This was the only .NET runtime until .NET
    Core came along and opened .NET up to Mac and Linux. ASP.NET Core can also run
    on Windows-only .NET Framework, but I won't touch on this too much.

    controllers can simply return views, status codes, or data. Dependency injection
    comes baked in, so you don''t need to install and configure a container like StructureMap
