    (When I was in middle school, I was sometimes allowed to play with a computer
    that used such a printing terminal.)

    the IBM PC came out in the early 1980s, it used a text-based operating system
    (MS-DOS) until Windows 3.1 appeared, about 10 years later.

    users interact with the computer by clicking with the mouse. That looks easier
    than writing textual commands, but it is also much more limited. You can express
    commands in text that perform quite complicated operations that would take you
    hundreds of mouse clicks to do by hand. And therefore the command line is still
    commonly used in software development, and some other places: the standard interface
    used by travel agents, for instance, is a command line interface.'
