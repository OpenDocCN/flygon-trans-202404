- en: Debugging the deployment and installation processes is often put off until close
    to the end of a project. In some projects writing installation tools is delegated
    to a release engineer who take on the task as a "necessary evil." Reviews and
    demonstrations are done from a hand-crafted environment to ensure that everything
    works. The result is that the team gets no experience with the deployment process
    or the deployed environment until it may be too late to make changes.

  zh: 调试部署和安装过程通常被推迟到项目接近尾声时才进行。在一些项目中，编写安装工具被委托给一个承担任务的发布工程师，作为一种“必要之恶”。从手工制作的环境中进行审查和演示以确保一切正常。结果是团队在可能为时已晚时才获得有关部署过程或部署环境的经验。
- en: The installation/deployment process is the first thing that the customer sees,
    and a simple installation/deployment process is the first step to having a reliable
    (or, at least, easy to debug) production environment. The deployed software is
    what the customer will use. By not ensuring that the deployment sets up the application
    correctly, you'll raise questions with your customer before they get to use your
    software thoroughly.

  zh: 安装/部署过程是客户看到的第一件事，简单的安装/部署过程是拥有可靠（或至少易于调试）的生产环境的第一步。部署的软件是客户将要使用的。如果不确保部署正确设置应用程序，您将在客户使用软件之前引起客户的疑问。
- en: Starting your project with an installation process will give you time to evolve
    the process as you move through the product development cycle, and the chance
    to make changes to the application code to make the installation easier. Running
    and testing the installation process on a clean environment periodically also
    provides a check that you have not made assumptions in the code that rely on the
    development or test environments.

  zh: 从安装过程开始您的项目将使您有时间在产品开发周期中逐步演变过程，并有机会对应用程序代码进行更改以使安装更容易。定期在干净的环境中运行和测试安装过程还可以检查您是否在代码中做出了依赖于开发或测试环境的假设。
- en: Putting deployment last means that the deployment process may need to be more
    complicated to work around assumptions in the code. What seemed a great idea in
    an IDE, where you have full control over an environment, might make for a much
    more complicated deployment process. It is better to know all the trade-offs sooner
    rather than later.

  zh: 将部署放在最后意味着部署过程可能需要更复杂的工作来解决代码中的假设。在IDE中看起来很棒的想法，在那里您对环境有完全控制，可能会导致更加复杂的部署过程。更好的做法是尽早了解所有权衡。
- en: 'While "being able to deploy" doesn''t seem to have a lot of business value
    early on as compared to seeing an application run on a developer''s laptop, the
    simple truth is that until you can demonstrate you application on the target environment,
    there is a lot of work to do before you can deliver business value. If your rationale
    for putting off a deployment process is that it is trivial, then do it anyway
    since it is low cost. If it''s too complicated, or if there are too many uncertainties,
    do what you would do with application code: experiment, evaluate, and refactor
    the deployment process as you go.'

  zh: “能够部署”在早期似乎与在开发人员的笔记本电脑上运行应用程序相比没有太多的商业价值，但简单的事实是，在你能够在目标环境中展示应用程序之前，还有很多工作要做才能提供商业价值。如果你推迟部署过程的理由是因为它微不足道，那么无论如何都要去做，因为成本很低。如果太复杂，或者存在太多不确定性，就像处理应用程序代码一样：在进行过程中进行实验，评估，并重构部署过程。
- en: The installation/deployment process is essential to the productivity of your
    customers or your professional services team, so you should be testing and refactoring
    this process as you go. We test and refactor the source code throughout a project.
    The deployment deserves no less.
