    in this chapter is the role of routine communication in the process of doing your
    data analysis and in disseminating your final results in a more formal setting,
    often to an external, larger audience. There are lots of good books that address
    the “how-to” of giving formal presentations, either in the form of a talk or a
    written piece, such as a white paper or scientific paper. In this chapter, though,
    we will focus on:'

    product of data analysis: there is no point in doing a data analysis if you’re
    not going to communicate your process and results to an audience. A good data
    analyst communicates informally multiple times during the data analysis process
    and also gives careful thought to communicating the final results so that the
    analysis is as useful and informative as possible to the wider audience it was
    intended for.'

- en: The main purpose of routine communication is to gather data, which is part of
    the epicyclic process for each core activity. You gather data by communicating
    your results and the responses you receive from your audience should inform the
    next steps in your data analysis. The types of responses you receive include not
    only answers to specific questions, but also commentary and questions your audience
    has in response to your report (either written or oral). The form that your routine
    communication takes depends on what the goal of the communication is. If your
    goal, for example, is to get clarity on how a variable is coded because when you
    explore the dataset it appears to be an ordinal variable, but you had understood
    that it was a continuous variable, your communication is brief and to the point.

- en: If, on the other hand, some results from your exploratory data analysis are
    not what you expected, your communication may take the form of a small, informal
    meeting that includes displaying tables and/or figures pertinent to your issue.
    A third type of informal communication is one in which you may not have specific
    questions to ask of your audience, but instead are seeking feedback on the data
    analysis process and/or results to help you refine the process and/or to inform
    your next steps.

    based on the objectives you have for the communication: (1) to answer a very focused
    question, which is often a technical question or a question aimed at gathering
    a fact, (2) to help you work through some results that are puzzling or not quite
    what you expected, and (3) to get general impressions and feedback as a means
    of identifying issues that had not occurred to you so that you can refine your
    data analysis.'

- en: For many types of routine communication, you will have the ability to select
    your audience, but in some cases, such as when you are delivering an interim report
    to your boss or your team, the audience may be pre-determined. Your audience may
    be composed of other data analysts, the individual(s) who initiated the question,
    your boss and/or other managers or executive team members, non-data analysts who
    are content experts, and/or someone representing the general public.

- en: For the first type of routine communication, in which you are primarily seeking
    factual knowledge or clarification about the dataset or related information, selecting
    a person (or people) who have the factual knowledge to answer the question and
    are responsive to queries is most appropriate. For a question about how the data
    for a variable in the dataset were collected, you might approach a person who
    collected the data or a person who has worked with the dataset before or was responsible
    for compiling the data. If the question is about the command to use in a statistical
    programming language in order to run a certain type of statistical test, this
    information is often easily found by an internet search. But if this fails, querying
    a person who uses the particular programming language would be appropriate.

- en: For the second type of routine communication, in which you have some results
    and you are either unsure whether they are what you’d expect, or they are not
    what you expected, you’ll likely be most helped if you engage more than one person
    and they represent a range of perspectives. The most productive and helpful meetings
    typically include people with data analysis and content area expertise. As a rule
    of thumb, the more types of stakeholders you communicate with while you are doing
    your data analysis project, the better your final product will be. For example,
    if you only communicate with other data analysts, you may overlook some important
    aspects of your data analysis that would have been discovered had you communicated
    with your boss, content experts, or other people.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For the third type of routine communication, which typically occurs when you
    have come to a natural place for pausing your data analysis. Although when and
    where in your data analysis these pauses occur are dictated by the specific analysis
    you are doing, one very common place to pause and take stock is after completing
    at least some exploratory data analysis. It’s important to pause and ask for feedback
    at this point as this exercise will often identify additional exploratory analyses
    that are important for informing next steps, such as model building, and therefore
    prevent you from sinking time and effort into pursuing models that are not relevant,
    not appropriate, or both. This sort of communication is most effective when it
    takes the form of a face-to-face meeting, but video conferencing and phone conversations
    can also be effective. When selecting your audience, think about who among the
    people available to you give the most helpful feedback and which perspectives
    will be important for informing the next steps of your analysis. At a minimum,
    you should have both data analysis and content expertise represented, but in this
    type of meeting it may also be helpful to hear from people who share, or at least
    understand, the perspective of the larger target audience for the formal communication
    of the results of your data analysis.

- en: The most important guiding principle is to tailor the information you deliver
    to the objective of the communication. For a targeted question aimed at getting
    clarification about the coding of a variable, the recipient of your communication
    does not need to know the overall objective of your analysis, what you have done
    up to this point, or see any figures or tables. A specific, pointed question along
    the lines of “I’m analyzing the crime dataset that you sent me last week and am
    looking at the variable “education” and see that it is coded 0, 1, and 2, but
    I don’t see any labels for those codes. Do you know what these codes for the “education”
    variable stand for?”

    of a puzzling or unexpected issue with your analysis, more background information
    will be needed, but complete background information for the overall project may
    not be. To illustrate this concept, let’s assume that you have been examining
    the relationship between height and lung function and you construct a scatterplot,
    which suggests that the relationship is non-linear as there appears to be curvature
    to the relationship. Although you have some ideas about approaches for handling
    non-linear relationships, you appropriately seek input from others. After giving
    some thought to your objectives for the communication, you settle on two primary
    objectives: (1) To understand if there is a best approach for handling the non-linearity
    of the relationship, and if so, how to determine which approach is best, and (2)
    To understand more about the non-linear relationship you observe, including whether
    this is expected and/or known and whether the non-linearity is important to capture
    in your analyses.'

    context and background, but providing a comprehensive background for the data
    analysis project and review of all of the steps you’ve taken so far is unnecessary
    and likely to absorb time and effort that would be better devoted to your specific
    objectives. In this example, appropriate context and background might include
    the following: (1) the overall objective of the data analysis, (2) how height
    and lung function fit into the overall objective of the data analysis, for example,
    height may be a potential confounder, or the major predictor of interest, and
    (3) what you have done so far with respect to height and lung function and what
    you’ve learned. This final step should include some visual display of data, such
    as the aforementioned scatterplot. The final content of your presentation, then,
    would include a statement of the objectives for the discussion, a brief overview
    of the data analysis project, how the specific issue you are facing fits into
    the overall data analysis project, and then finally, pertinent findings from your
    analysis related to height and lung function.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you were developing a slide presentation, fewer slides should be devoted
    to the background and context than the presentation of the data analysis findings
    for height and lung function. One slide should be sufficient for the data analysis
    overview, and 1-2 slides should be sufficient for explaining the context of the
    height-lung function issue within the larger data analysis project. The meat of
    the presentation shouldn’t require more than 5-8 slides, so that the total presentation
    time should be no more than 10-15 minutes. Although slides are certainly not necessary,
    a visual tool for presenting this information is very helpful and should not imply
    that the presentation should be “formal.” Instead, the idea is to provide the
    group sufficient information to generate discussion that is focused on your objectives,
    which is best achieved by an informal presentation.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: These same principles apply to the third type of communication, except that
    you may not have focused objectives and instead you may be seeking general feedback
    on your data analysis project from your audience. If this is the case, this more
    general objective should be stated and the remainder of the content should include
    a statement of the question you are seeking to answer with the analysis, the objective(s)
    of the data analysis, a summary of the characteristics of the data set (source
    of the data, number of observations, etc.), a summary of your exploratory analyses,
    a summary of your model building, your interpretation of your results, and conclusions.
    By providing key points from your entire data analysis, your audience will be
    able to provide feedback about the overall project as well as each of the steps
    of data analysis. A well-planned discussion yields helpful, thoughtful feedback
    and should be considered a success if you are left armed with additional refinements
    to make to your data analysis and thoughtful perspective about what should be
    included in the more formal presentation of your final results to an external
    audience.

- en: Although the style of communication increases in formality from the first to
    the third type of routine communication, all of these communications should largely
    be informal and, except for perhaps the focused communication about a small technical
    issue, jargon should be avoided. Because the primary purpose of routine communication
    is to get feedback, your communication style should encourage discussion. Some
    approaches to encourage discussion include stating up front that you would like
    the bulk of the meeting to include active discussion and that you welcome questions
    during your presentation rather than asking the audience to hold them until the
    end of your presentation. If an audience member provides commentary, asking what
    others in the audience think will also promote discussion. In essence, to get
    the best feedback you want to hear what your audience members are thinking, and
    this is most likely accomplished by setting an informal tone and actively encouraging
    discussion.

- en: A defensive or off-putting attitude can sabotage all the work you’ve put into
    carefully selecting the audience, thoughtfully identifying your objectives and
    preparing your content, and stating that you are seeking discussion. Your audience
    will be reluctant to offer constructive feedback if they sense that their feedback
    will not be well received and you will leave the meeting without achieving your
    objectives, and ill prepared to make any refinements or additions to your data
    analysis. And when it comes time to deliver a formal presentation to an external
    audience, you will not be well prepared and won’t be able to present your best
    work. To avoid this pitfall, deliberately cultivate a receptive and positive attitude
    prior to communicating by putting your ego and insecurities aside. If you can
    do this successfully, it will serve you well. In fact, we both know people who
    have had highly successful careers based largely on their positive and welcoming
    attitude towards feedback, including constructive criticism.
