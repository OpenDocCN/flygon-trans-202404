- en: This document is meant to be a collaborative discussion of the best practices
    in C++. It complements books such as *Effective C++* (Meyers) and *C++ Coding
    Standards* (Alexandrescu, Sutter). We fill in some of the lower level details
    that they don't discuss and provide specific stylistic recommendations while also
    discussing how to ensure overall code quality.

    making the case for why one option is preferred over another. If necessary, words
    will be used.
