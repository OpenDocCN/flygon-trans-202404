    of operations (arithmetic ones, substitution and inversion) to combinations of
    three original functions, we can differentiate any standard function if we know
    how to differentiate each of the three functions, and how to differentiate a function
    obtained from others by each of the operations in terms of the derivatives of
    the others.

    but should be mentioned. They can and often do occur in upper (or lower) limits
    of integration. You will learn how to differentiate a function of this kind when
    that concept is discussed. You should be aware here though, that when a variable
    occurs both as such a limit and as an ordinary function, you can invoke the "separate
    occurrence" rule to treat these occurrences each individually and add the contributions
    to the derivative coming from each to get the entire derivative.
