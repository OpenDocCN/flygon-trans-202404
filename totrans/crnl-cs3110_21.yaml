- en: So far in this class we have only considered sequential programs. Execution
    of a sequential program proceeds one step at a time, with no choice about which
    step to take next. Sequential programs are limited in that they are not very good
    at dealing with multiple sources of simultaneous input and they can only execute
    on a single processor. For these reasons, many modern applications are concurrent.
    There are many different approaches to concurrent programming, but they all share
    the fact that a program is split into multiple independent threads of execution.
    Each thread runs a sequential program, but the overall collection of threads no
    longer produces a single overall predictable sequence of execution steps. Instead,
    execution proceeds *concurrently*, resulting in potentially unpredictable order
    of execution for steps in one thread with respect to steps in other threads.

    techniques that loosely coordinate the execution of separate programs, such as
    *pipes* in Unix (or even the HTTP protocol between Web servers and clients), to
    fine-grained techniques where the concurrent threads share the same memory, such
    as *lightweight threads*.

- en: 'As examples to motivate concurrent programming, consider implementing a graphical
    user interface that handles interactive input, a web crawler that builds up a
    database of web pages, and a typical server. A graphical user interface that did
    not have a separate execution thread for user interaction would be frustrating
    to use because it would not "lock up" until the current action is completed. For
    example, web browsers simultaneously handle input from the graphical user interface,
    read and render web pages incrementally as new data comes in over the network,
    and also run JavaScript programs embedded in web pages. All these activities happen
    at once, so typically separate threads are used to handle each of them. Another
    example of a naturally concurrent application is a web crawler, which traverses
    the web collecting information about the structure and content of pages. It doesn''t
    make sense for the web crawler to access each site sequentially, because most
    of the time would be spent waiting for the remote server and network to respond
    to each request. Therefore, web crawlers are typically highly concurrent, simultaneously
    accessing thousands of different web sites. This design uses the processor and
    network efficiently. Lastly, naive sequential servers would not behave as expected,
    as it would only process requests from clients one at a time. There are two commonly-used
    approaches to implementing servers:'

- en: Both of these approaches have advantages and disadvantages. Using threads requires
    complex synchronization or communication to ensure that system-wide resources
    such as shared memory are used correctly. Using event loops complicates the control
    flow of the program, since multiple sequential steps of execution must be threaded
    through several iterations of the loop.

- en: 'Concurrency is powerful and it enables new kinds of applications, but it also
    makes writing correct programs more difficult, because execution of a concurrent
    program is *nondeterministic*: the order in which operations occur is not always
    known ahead of time. As a result, the programmer must think about all possible
    orders in which the different threads might execute, and make sure that in all
    of them the program works correctly. If the program is purely functional, nondeterminism
    is easier because evaluation of an expression always returns the same value no
    matter what. For example, in the expression `(2*4)+(3*5)`, the operations can
    be executed concurrently (e.g., with the left and right products evaluated simultaneously)
    without changing the answer. Imperative programming is more problematic. For example,
    the expressions `(!x)` and `(x := !x+1)`, if executed by two different threads,
    could give different results depending on which thread executes first.'
