- en: We seek, (and find) analogues to the fundamental theorem of calculus for surface
    and volume integrals. To do this we examine constructs with the same additive
    properties as our integrals because any theorem that relates an integral to something
    else must relate it to something else with the same additivity property. With
    clues from this fact, we find the results we seek, which are Stokes Theorem and
    the Divergence Theorem, which are the most powerful tools in this subject.

- en: The fundamental theorems in two and three dimensions are among the most important
    and influential results of all time in any subject. They provide the keys that
    allow representation of the laws governing electric and magnetic phenomena as
    differential equations, which is the source of our understanding of the structure
    of physics and to the development of radio and all that has followed from it.

    path in several dimension, or on surfaces or volumes have the important property

    (which was in turn, interval on a curve in the complex plane, or on a path in
    several dimensions, or on a small element of area in the plane or on a surface
    or an element of volume in three dimensions.)'

    on it; and **defined this product on a large piece to be the sum of its values
    on a partition of that piece (into "Riemann sums") of its value on smaller pieces.**
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    each case we could claim that for a continuous function f the resulting sum converged
    to a limiting value which we called an integral.

    have this same "additive" property, value on the "sum" of several pieces is the
    sum of its value on each piece.**
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    and it is clear that any other thing that might be equal to an integral of some
    kind in general, must share at least this property.
