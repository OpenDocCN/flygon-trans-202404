    operations; thus the area under a curve is an antiderivative of its integrand
    as a function of the upper end of the area. We explore proof of this claim and
    its implications for one dimensional integrals.

- en: For an ordinary integral of a real function over an interval of the real line,
    the fundamental theorem of calculus is the statement that the definite integral
    is an anti-derivative. This means that differentiation undoes integration and
    vice versa, to the extent that it can.

    a to y into tiny subintervals the **result claimed follows if it is true in each
    subinterval.**

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    us that **the difference in f between its endpoints is their separation times
    the derivative of f at some intermediate point.**
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Thus the actual difference in f over the interval from x to x + d, **f(x + d)
    - f(x), can be considered the contribution from that subinterval to some Riemann
    sum, ![](../Images/95d6e9720179a4799f8d718733aa0440.jpg) for some point x' in
    the interval.**
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Since the existence of the integral implies that all the Riemann sums converge
    to it, the particular subset of them obtainable by applying the mean value theorem
    on each sub-interval must do so as the maximum ds goes to zero, and we find **that
    the integral of the derivative is the change in f between the endpoints in each
    infinitesimal subinterval.**

    and polynomials all are always well defined and their integrals always obey the

    the minus first power in a power series expansion around that point is called
    the **residue** of the function at the point. **The integral of the function around
