- en: The objectives of this chapter are to describe what the concept of a model is
    more generally, to explain what the purpose of a model is with respect to a set
    of data, and last, to describe the process by which a data analyst creates, assesses,
    and refines a model. In a very general sense, a model is something we construct
    to help us understand the real world. A common example is the use of an animal
    which mimics a human disease to help us understand, and hopefully, prevent and/or
    treat the disease. The same concept applies to a set of data–presumably you are
    using the data to understand the real world.

    and the pollster’s job is to use this sample to predict the election outcome.
    The data analyst uses the polling data to construct a model to predict what will
    happen on Election Day. The process of building a model involves imposing a specific
    structure on the data and creating a summary of the data. In the polling data
    example, you may have thousands of observations, so the model is a mathematical
    equation that reflects the shape or pattern of the data, and the equation allows
    you to summarize the thousands of observations with, for example, one number,
    which might be the percentage of voters who will vote for your candidate. Right
    now, these last concepts may be a bit fuzzy, but they will become much clearer
    as you read on.

- en: A statistical model serves two key purposes in a data analysis, which are to
    provide a *quantitative summary* of your data and to impose a specific *structure*
    on the population from which the data were sampled. It’s sometimes helpful to
    understand what a model is and why it can be useful through the illustration of
    extreme examples. The trivial “model” is simply **no model at all**.

    be willing to spend on a product you’re developing. What is the goal of this survey?
    Presumably, if you’re spending time and money developing a new product, you believe
    that there is a large *population* of people out there who are willing to buy
    this product. However, it’s far too costly and complicated to ask everyone in
    that population what they’d be willing to pay. So you take a *sample* from that
    population to get a sense of what the population would pay.

    Science*](https://leanpub.com/rprogramming). Before the book was published, interested
    readers could submit their name and email address to the book’s web site to be
    notified about the books publication. In addition, there was an option to specify
    how much they’d be willing to pay for the book. Below is a random sample of 20
    responses from people who volunteered this information.

    could do is simply hand over the data—all 20 numbers. Since the dataset is not
    that big, it’s not like this would be a huge burden. Ultimately, the answer to
    their question is in that dataset, but having all the data isn’t a summary of
    any sort. Having all the data is important, but is often not very useful. This
    is because the trivial model provides no reduction of the data.'

- en: The first key element of a statistical model is *data reduction*. The basic
    idea is you want to take the original set of numbers consisting of your dataset
    and transform them into a smaller set of numbers. If you originally started with
    20 numbers, your model should produce a summary that is fewer than 20 numbers.
    The process of data reduction typically ends up with a *statistic*. Generally
    speaking, a statistic is any summary of the data. The sample mean, or average,
    is a statistic. So is the median, the standard deviation, the maximum, the minimum,
    and the range. Some statistics are more or less useful than others but they are
    all summaries of the data.

    arithmetic average, of the data, which in this case is $17.2\. Going from 20 numbers
    to 1 number is about as much reduction as you can do in this case, so it definitely
    satisfies the summary element of a model.

- en: But a simple summary statistic, such as the mean of a set of numbers, is not
    enough to formulate a model. A statistical model must also impose some structure
    on the data. At its core, **a statistical model provides a description of how
    the world works and how the data were generated**. The model is essentially an
    *expectation* of the relationships between various factors in the real world and
    in your dataset. What makes a model a *statistical model* is that it allows for
    some randomness in generating the data.

    This model says that the randomness in a set of data can be explained by the Normal
    distribution, or a bell-shaped curve. The Normal distribution is fully specified
    by two parameters—the mean and the standard deviation.

    20 people were willing to pay for a hypothetical new product. The hope is that
    these 20 people are a representative sample of the entire population of people
    who might purchase this new product. If that’s the case, then the information
    contained in the dataset can tell you something about everyone in the population.

- en: To apply the Normal model to this dataset, we just need to calculate the mean
    and standard deviation. In this case, the mean is $17.2 and the standard deviation
    is $10.39\. Given those parameters, our expectation under the Normal model is
    that the distribution of prices that people are willing to pay looks something
    like this.

    somewhere between $6.81 and $27.59 for this new product. Whether that is useful
    information or not depends on the specifics of the situation, which we will gloss
    over for the moment.

    For example, suppose you wanted to know “What proportion of the population would
    be willing to pay more than $30 for this book?” Using the properties of the Normal
    distribution (and a little computational help from R), we can easily do this calculation.
