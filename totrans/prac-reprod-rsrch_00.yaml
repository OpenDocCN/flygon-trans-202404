- en: This book contains a collection of 31 case studies of reproducible research
    workflows, written by academic researchers in the data-intensive sciences. Each
    case study describes how the author combined specific tools, ideas, and practices
    in order to complete a real-world research project. Emphasis is placed on the
    practical aspects of how the author organized his or her research to make it as
    reproducible as possible.
