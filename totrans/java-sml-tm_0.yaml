    practices that help produce it.

    blindly consider only one or two concerns (often the ones with catchy acronyms)
    without thought for others.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We've carefully set out the context in which we think the advice in this book
    will be useful, but the context is still very broad. Slightly different situations
    might benefit from very different trade offs. What worked well for you in one
    project might not work so well in the next.

    in this book please stop and think first. Don't fall into the trap of thinking
    certain advice cannot apply to you. We often make our worst mistakes when we believe
    we are being elegant or clever. The full horror of our ineptitude sometimes does
    not become apparent for months or years.
