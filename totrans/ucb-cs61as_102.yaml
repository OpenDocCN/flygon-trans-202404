- en: You've finished Part 1 of the Adventure Game! At this point, you should have
    finished Questions 1, 2, A3-A5, and B3-B5\. Now is the time to combine these answers
    into one file. Make sure everything still works correctly after merging.

- en: Make sure you make a transcript that shows us your project works! To be complete,
    it should adequately test all of your modifications, for both partners. If you
    can't get something to work, include it in the transcript as well, as you may
    get partial credit for conscious errors.

- en: The second part of the project includes three exercises for each partner, but
    **you must read each other's code midway**, because one partner's Questions 7
    and 8 build on the other partner's Question 6\. Finally, Question 9 requires the
    two partners' work to be combined. You will have to create a version of `adv.scm`
    that has both partners' changes. This may take some thinking! If both parners
    modify the same method in the same object class, you'll have to write a version
    of the method that incorporates both modifications.
