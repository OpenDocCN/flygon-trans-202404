- en: I worked with programmers who, when asked to produce a count of the lines of
    code in a module, pasted the files into a word processor and used its "line count"
    feature. And they did it again next week. And the week after. It was bad.

- en: I worked on a project that had a cumbersome deployment process, involving code
    signing and moving the result to a server, requiring many mouse clicks. Someone
    automated it and the script ran hundreds of times during final testing, far more
    often than anticipated. It was good.

    taking the time to automate it?

    in any project: version control, compiling, building JAR files, documentation
    generation, deployment, and reporting. For many of these tasks, the script is
    mightier than the mouse. Executing tedious tasks becomes faster and more reliable.'

- en: Did you ever have a "But it (checks out|builds|passes tests) on my machine?"
    argument with your teammates? Modern IDEs have thousands of potential settings,
    and it is essentially impossible to ensure that all team members have identical
    configurations. Build automation systems such as Ant or Autotools give you control
    and repeatability.

    and a build automation system. If you need to interact with web sites, use a tool
    such as iMacros or Selenium.

- en: If a part of your process requires Word documents, spreadsheets, or images,
    it may indeed be challenging to automate it. But is that really necessary? Can
    you use plain text? Comma-separated values? XML? A tool that generates a drawing
    from a text file? Often, a slight tweak in the process can yield good results
    with a dramatic reduction in tediousness.

- en: You don't have to learn all of bash or Ant to get started. Learn as you go.
    When you have a task that you think can and should be automated, learn just enough
    about your tools to do it. And do it early in a project when time is usually easier
    to find. Once you have been successful, you (and your boss) will see that it makes
    sense to invest in automation.
