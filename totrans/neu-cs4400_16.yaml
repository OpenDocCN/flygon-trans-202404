- en: You have seen this in Fundamentals with the design recipe and with templates.
    In this class, we will see it extensively with type definitions and the (cases
    …) form. Types make this pervasive — we have to think about our data before our
    code.

  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Instead of having an informal language for describing types in contract lines,
    and a more formal description of predicates in a `define-type` form, we will have
    a single, unified language for both of these. Having such a language means that
    we get to be more precise and more expressive (since the typed language covers
    cases that you would otherwise dismiss with some hand waving, like “a function”).

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Racket is the language we all know, and it has the benefits that we discussed
    earlier. Mainly, it is an excellent language for experimenting with programming
    languages.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Typed Racket allows us to take our Racket programs and typecheck them, so we
    get the benefits of a statically typed language.
  prefs:

    us understand them.

- en: How is Typed Racket different from Racket
  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Typed Racket will reject your program if there are type errors! This means that
    it does that at compile-time, *before* any code gets to run.

- en: Note that in the Typed Racket case, the language keeps track of information
    that is gathered via predicates — which is why it knows that one `x` is a String,
    and the other is a Number.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Typed Racket has a concept of subtypes — which is also something that most statically
    typed languages lack. In fact, the fact that it has (arbitrary) unions means that
    it must have subtypes too, since a type is always a subtype of a union that contains
    this type.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Another result of this feature is that there is an `Any` type that is the union
    of all other types. Note that you can always use this type since everything is
    in it — but it gives you the *least* information about a value. In other words,
    Typed Racket gives you a choice: *you* decide which type to use, one that is very
    restricted but has a lot of information about its values to a type that is very
    permissive but has almost no useful information. This is in contrast to other
    type system (HM systems) where there is always exactly one correct type.'

    know nothing about the result — in fact, `(+ 1 (id 2))` will throw a type error.
    It *does* return `2`, as expected, but the type checker doesn’t know the type
    of that `2`. If you wanted to use this type, you’d need to check that the result
    is a number, eg:'

- en: 'Another interesting thing to look at is the type of `error`: it’s a function
    that returns a type of `Nothing` — a type that is the same as an *empty* union:
    `(U)`. It’s a type that has no values in it — it fits `error` because it *is*
    a function that doesn’t return any value, in fact, it doesn’t return at all. In
    addition, it means that an `error` expression can be used anywhere you want because
    it is a subtype of anything at all.'
