- en: Recently I was at a grocery store searching high and low for "edamame" (which
    I only vaguely knew was some kind of a vegetable). I wasn't sure whether this
    was something I'd find in the vegetable section, the frozen section, or in a can.
    I gave up and tracked down an employee to help me out. She didn't know either!

  zh: 最近我在一家杂货店里到处寻找"毛豆"（我只模糊知道这是某种蔬菜）。我不确定这是我能在蔬菜区、冷冻区还是罐头里找到的东西。我放弃了，并找到一个员工帮助我。她也不知道！
- en: The employee could have responded in many different ways. She could have made
    me feel ignorant for not knowing where to look, or given me vague possibilities,
    or even just told me they didn't have the item. But instead she treated the request
    as an opportunity to find a solution and help a customer. She called other employees
    and within minutes had guided me to the exact item, nestled in the frozen section.

  zh: 员工可以以许多不同的方式作出回应。她本可以让我觉得自己无知，因为不知道去哪里找，或者给我模糊的可能性，甚至只是告诉我他们没有这个东西。但是她选择把请求视为找到解决方案并帮助顾客的机会。她叫来其他员工，几分钟内就引导我找到了精确的物品，就在冷冻区里。
- en: The employee in this case looked at a request and started from the premise that
    we would solve the problem and satisfy the request. She started from *yes* instead
    of starting from no.

- en: When I was first placed in a technical leadership role, I felt that my job was
    to protect my beautiful software from the ridiculous stream of demands coming
    from product managers and business analysts. I started most conversations seeing
    a request as something to defeat, not something to grant.

  zh: 当我第一次担任技术领导职务时，我觉得我的工作是保护我的优秀软件不受产品经理和业务分析师无休止的要求的影响。我大多数时候都是把请求视为要击败的东西，而不是要满足的东西。
- en: At some point, I had an epiphany that maybe there was a different way to work
    that merely involved shifting my perspective from starting at no to starting at
    *yes*. In fact, I've come to believe that starting from *yes* is actually an essential
    part of being a technical leader.

  zh: 在某个时刻，我突然意识到，也许有一种不同的工作方式，仅仅涉及将我的视角从不开始转移到从*是*开始。事实上，我逐渐相信，从*是*开始实际上是成为技术领导者的一个基本部分。
- en: This simple change radically altered how I approached my job. As it turns out,
    there are a lot of ways to say *yes*. When someone says to you "Hey, this app
    would really be the bees knees if we made all the windows round and translucent!"
    you could reject it as ridiculous. But it's often better to start with "Why?"
    instead. Often there is some actual and compelling reason why that person is asking
    for round translucent windows in the first place. For example, you may be just
    about to sign a big new customer with a standards committee that mandates round
    translucent windows.

  zh: 这个简单的改变彻底改变了我对待工作的方式。事实证明，有很多种方式可以说*是*。当有人对你说："嘿，如果我们把所有的窗口都做成圆的和半透明的，这个应用会非常棒！"时，你可能会拒绝，认为这是荒谬的。但更好的做法通常是从"为什么？"开始。通常，那个人之所以要求圆形透明窗口，是有一些实际且令人信服的理由的。例如，你可能正要签约一个要求使用圆形透明窗口的标准委员会的重要新客户。
- en: 'Usually you''ll find that when you known the context of the request, new possibilities
    open up. It''s common for the request to be accomplished with the existing product
    in some other way allowing you to say *yes* with no work at all: "Actually, in
    the user preferences you can download the round translucent windows skin and turn
    it on."'

  zh: 通常情况下，当你了解请求的背景时，新的可能性就会出现。常见的情况是，可以通过现有产品以其他方式完成请求，而不需要任何工作："实际上，在用户偏好中，你可以下载圆形透明窗口的皮肤并将其打开"。
- en: Sometimes the other person will simply have an idea that you find incompatible
    with your view of the product. I find it's usually helpful to turn that "Why?"
    on yourself. Sometimes the act of voicing the reason will make it clear that your
    first reaction doesn't make sense. If not, you might need to kick it up a notch
    and bring in other key decision makers. Remember, the goal of all of this is to
    say *yes* to the other person and try to make it work, not just for him but for
    you and your team as well.

  zh: 有时，对方可能只是有一个你认为与产品观点不相容的想法。我发现把那个"为什么？"转移到你自己身上通常会有帮助。有时候，说出理由会让你清楚地知道你的第一反应没有意义。如果不是这样，你可能需要加大力度，引入其他关键决策者。记住，所有这些的目标都是对对方说*是*，并尝试使其起作用，不仅为了他，也为了你和你的团队。
- en: If you can voice a compelling explanation as to why the feature request is incompatible
    with the existing product, then you are likely to have a productive conversation
    about whether you are building the right product. Regardless of how that conversation
    concludes, everyone will focus more sharply on what the product is, and what it
    is not.

  zh: 如果你能够提出令人信服的解释，说明为什么该功能请求与现有产品不兼容，那么你很可能会就是否正在构建正确的产品进行富有成效的讨论。无论该对话如何结束，每个人都会更加集中地关注产品的本质，以及它不是什么。
