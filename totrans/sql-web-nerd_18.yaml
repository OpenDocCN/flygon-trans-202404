    Web services for collaboration, which I think are the most valuable things that
    we nerds can give to society. To that end, I wrote Philip and Alex's Guide to
    Web Publishing, available at [http://philip.greenspun.com/panda/](/panda/) and
    more recently Software Engineering for Internet Applications, at [http://philip.greenspun.com/seia/](/seia/)
