    Although each data set is its own unique organism and each analysis has its own
    specific issues to contend with, tackling each step with the epicycle framework
    is useful for any analysis. As you work through developing your question, exploring
    your data, modeling your data, interpreting your results, and communicating your
    results, remember to always set expectations and then compare the result of your
    action to your expectations. If they don’t match, identify whether the problem
    is with the result of your action or your expectations and fix the problem so
    that they do match. If you can’t identify the problem, seek input from others,
    and then when you’ve fixed the problem, move on to the next action. This epicycle
    framework will help to keep you on a course that will end at a useful answer to
    your question.

    that we discussed throughout the book. Although all of the analysis activities
    are important, if we had to identify the ones that are most important for ensuring
    that your data analysis provides a valid, meaningful, and interpretable answer
    to your question, we would include the following:'

    nature is to do a lot of data analysis, so we encourage you to take advantage
    of the data analysis opportunities that come your way. Although with practice,
    many of these principles will become second nature to you, we have found that
    revisiting these principles has helped to resolve a range of issues we’ve faced
    in our own analyses. We hope, then, that the book continues to serve as a useful
    resource after you’re done reading it when you hit the stumbling blocks that occur
    in every analysis.
