    and differentiability in this case and in higher dimensions as well.
  prefs: []

    it is much more interesting now. Quadratic functions of two or more variables
    are much more varied than those of one variable.

    way.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The second partial derivative of f with respect to two variables is obtained
    by taking the first partial with respect to one and then taking the partial of
    that function with respect to the next.

    differentiable f, **the order of taking them does not matter.**

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    looks like that of x² in one dimension and f will have a minimum at (x[0], y[0]).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    will have a maximum at this point just as -x² - y² has at (0, 0).

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    and falls in others.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    in some directions and is flat in another: like x² in two dimensions. I don''t
    know what you should call that behavior. As in one dimension, when this happens
    you have to look to higher derivatives in the derivative = 0 direction to know
    whether you have a true local maximum or minimum.'

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We have seen that at a critical point a function in two dimensions can have
    a minimum, or a maximum or a saddle.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**We want to know how to determine which will happen from the formula for the
    function.**'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We are particularly concerned about the quadratic behavior of the function at
    the critical point.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This behavior is determined from the second derivatives, and is that of the
    quadratic that those second derivatives determine.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'So we really want to know: **given a quadratic function of two variables, with
    no linear term, when will it have a maximum and when a minimum and when neither
    at the origin?**'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'And here is the answer:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We can associate a matrix to the function, the matrix of its second partial
    derivatives at its critical point, as defined in the last section.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The behavior of the quadratic is determined by the eigenvalues of that matrix.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When they are real and positive you get a minimum, when real and negative you
    get a maximum, and otherwise a saddle, unless one is 0 in which case you get flatness.
    (Which means that for a general function you must look to higher derivatives in
    such directions.)
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Why is that?**'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The eigenvector corresponding to an eigenvalue is a linear combination of the
    basis vectors **i** and **j**. It represents a direction in which you can move
    from the critical point in which the quadratic will behave like its eigenvalue
    multiplied by distance in that direction.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Thus if both eigenvalues are real and positive the function will look like ax'²
    + by'² for positive a and b with x' and y' coordinates in appropriate directions
    and our function will have a minimum.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: On the other hand if they have opposite signs, the function will increase in
    one direction and decrease in the other and we will have a saddle.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**And if there are complex eigenvalues?**'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There can't be any! Because our matrix is real and symmetric (remember that
    mixed partial derivatives are independent of the order in which you take them),
    all its eigenvalues are real.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And further, the eigenvectors corresponding to different eigenvalues are always
    normal to one another!
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Which means that the behavior of the quadratic looks exactly like a'² + b'²
    does at the origin, except that the axes may be rotated into the directions of
    the eigenvectors.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'A brief discussion of the relevant properties of matrices and eigenvalues appears
    in [Chapter 32](../chapter32/contents.html). You can look for two by two eigenvalues
    graphically with the applet: [Multiplication of a Vector by a Matrix](../chapter03/section04.html#MultiplicationVectorByMatrix).'

- en: '**What happens in three dimensions?**'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Exactly the same statements apply, except that now we have a three by three
    symmetric matrix of second partial derivatives.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Its eigenvalues will be real, and you get a minimum if they all are positive
    and a maximum if they all are negative. With mixed signs you get a saddle, and
    if some eigenvectors are 0 you must look at higher derivatives in those directions
    to determine what goes on. Again the eigenvectors corresponding to different eigenvalues
    will be orthogonal.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    in it are present and alternate in sign, you get a minimum, and if they all have
    the same sign you get a maximum, else neither.**
