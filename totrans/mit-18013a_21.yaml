- en: The area between the curve defined by a positive function f and the x axis between
    two specific values of y is called the definite integral of f between those values.
    Starting with the fact that the area of a rectangle is the product of its side
    lengths, we can give a formal definition of the area under a general curve. The
    method of doing this used is generalized to define a wide variety of integrals
    that do not describe area. These include integration on a path in the complex
    plane, along a path in any Euclidean space, over an area in the plane, over a
    surface in three dimensional space and over volume.

    of mass within a region; for magnetic fields, the apparent absence of magnetic
    charge (monopoles) means that the right hand side of the comparable equation is
    0 for magnetic fields.)

    to the z-axis) multiplied by the mass density over a volume V gives the **moment
