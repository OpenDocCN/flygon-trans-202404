    job is to manage a computer''s resources efficiently—if a programmer writes a
    program that is too inefficient, the computer will run out of resources attempting
    to execute it. There are two broad ways a program can be inefficient: space and
    time. Space is the amount of "scratch paper" the computer requires to carry out
    a program. Time is the amount of time required before the computer finishes running
    a program. In the following sections, we will examine both of these dimensions
    in detail.'

    much space to run, leading the computer to crash. We will examine what causes
    this and how we may prevent it through a specific type of recursion—tail recursion.

    of the universe. (For example, the best programs we know to find a perfect solution
    to Chess.) We will learn how to identify such programs, and more generally, introduce
    and practice a method in which to measure how time-efficient our programs are.

- en: Lastly, we will also describe another new type of recursion—tree recursion.
    Utilizing tree recursion in our programs allows us to tackle problems that we
    previously didn't have the tools to solve. We will particularly focus on what
    the costs and benefits this new technique brings.
