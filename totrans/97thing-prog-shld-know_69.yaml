- en: You've been focused for hours on some gnarly problem and there's no solution
    in sight. So you get up to stretch your legs, or to hit the vending machines,
    and on the way back the answer suddenly becomes obvious.

- en: Does this scenario sound familiar? Ever wonder why it happens? The trick is
    that while you're coding, the logical part of your brain is active and the creative
    side is shut out. It can't present anything to you until the logical side takes
    a break.

- en: 'Here''s a real-life example: I was cleaning up some legacy code and ran into
    an ''interesting'' method. It was designed to verify that a string contained a
    valid time using the format *hh:mm:ss xx*, where *hh* represents the hour, *mm*
    represents minutes, *ss* represents seconds, and *xx* is either *AM* or *PM*.'

    the hour) into a number, and verify it was within the proper range:'

    offset and upper limit, to test the minutes and seconds. The method ended with
    these lines to check for AM and PM:'

    so too — which meant I'd found something worth cleaning up. I refactored it and
    wrote a few unit tests, just to make sure it still worked.

    read, half the size, and more accurate because the original code tested only the
    upper boundary for the hours, minutes, and seconds.

    validate the string using a regular expression? After a few minutes typing, I

- en: The point of this story is not that I eventually replaced over thirty lines
    of code with just one. The point is that until I got away from the computer, I
    thought my first attempt was the best solution to the problem.

    understand the problem go do something involving the creative side of your brain
    — sketch out the problem, listen to some music, or just take a walk outside. Sometimes
    the best thing you can do to solve a problem is to put the mouse down and step
    away from the keyboard.
