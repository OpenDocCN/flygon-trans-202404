  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A local maximum (or minimum) of a function is a point inside the domain in which
    our function takes a value greater than its value on its neighbors.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A point q at which f has non-zero directional derivative in any direction in
    which we can move both forward and back, cannot be a maximum or minimum, since
    moving in that direction from q forward and back will cause f to increase one
    way and decrease in the other.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The basic condition for an interior "extremum" at point q of a differentiable
    function f is then that **f have zero derivative in every direction that you are
    allowed to move from q while obeying the conditions on your problem.**
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**For a function of one variable this is just the condition that f '' = 0 at
    x = q, which is to say that q is a critical point for f.**'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To find whether f has a maximum or minimum at a critical point you must look
    to the quadratic approximation (or if necessary to the first higher approximation
    at which f deviates from flatness) to f. If its second derivative is **positive**
    then, like x², f has a **minimum** at q, and if it is negative f has a maximum.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**You should always check whether any local maximum or minimum that you find
    is the "global" maximum or minimum of f. That global extreme point (or any such
    points) can occur on a boundary, or at a different local extremum from the first
    one you find.**'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If f is a function of several variables then strange things can go on even in
    the quadratic approximation, and q being a critical point does not imply that
    it is a maximum or minimum even when the quadratic approximation is far from flat.
    As noted in [Chapter 11](../chapter11/contents.html), q could easily be a saddle
    point and you have to check for that as indicated in that chapter.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To solve such problems you look for critical points of f by setting all its
    derivatives to zero, and solving the resulting equations. Then you must check
    whether you have a maximum, minimum or saddle point.

    of the tangent line to the curve. Our condition above for an extremum then tells
    us that for q to be an extremum of F, F must have 0 derivative in the direction
    of the tangent, **t**, to the curve defined by G.

    to a two dimensional problem in the two parameters of the surface, with no restriction
    on the parameters. Finding critical points then involves solving the equations
    gotten by setting the partial derivatives of F with respect to the parameters
    to 0\. The two dimensional [Newton's Method](../chapter13/section01.html) of the
    last chapter can be used to do this for a numerical example.
