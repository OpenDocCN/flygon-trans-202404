    and get the gist of the upcoming examples in this series. Don't worry if you don't
    understand all of it, as I will give more detailed explanations when we get to
    the actual code examples.

    seeing it but to hinder readability ever after is a really bad mistake." (David

    you get used to it. In many ways, it is simpler than the C# syntax, with fewer
    keywords and special cases.

    always use `;;` at the end to tell the interpreter that you are done entering
    and ready to evaluate.
