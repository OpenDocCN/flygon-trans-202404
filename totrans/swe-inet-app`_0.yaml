- en: If you're confused by the "student knows how to build amazon.com" statement,
    we can break it down in terms of principles and skills. The fundamental difference
    between server-based Internet applications and the desktop applications that students
    have already learned to build is that server-based applications have multiple
    simultaneous users. Coupled with the unreliability of networks, this gives rise
    to the problems of concurrency and transactions. Stateless communications protocols
    such as HTTP mean that the student must learn how to build a stateful user experience
    on top of stateless protocols. For persistence between clicks and management of
    concurrency and transactions, the student needs to learn how to use the relational
    database management system. Finally, though, this goes beyond the simple standalone
    amazon.com-style service, students ought to learn about object-oriented distributed
    computing where each object is a Web service.
  id: totrans-40
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 如果你对“学生知道如何构建amazon.com”这一说法感到困惑，我们可以从原则和技能的角度来解释。基于服务器的互联网应用与学生已经学会构建的桌面应用程序之间的根本区别在于服务器应用具有多个同时用户。再加上网络的不可靠性，这就带来了并发和事务的问题。无状态通信协议（如HTTP）意味着学生必须学会如何在无状态协议之上构建有状态的用户体验。为了在点击之间保持持久性并管理并发和事务，学生需要学会使用关系数据库管理系统。最后，尽管这超出了简单的独立amazon.com风格的服务，学生们应该学习关于面向对象的分布式计算，其中每个对象都是一个Web服务。
- en: In addition to learning these principles, we'd like the student to learn some
    skills. This is a laboratory course, and we want students who graduate to be competent
    software engineers. We'd like our students to be able to take vague and ambitious
    specifications and turn them into a system design that can be built and launched
    within a few months, with the features most important to users and easiest to
    develop built first and the difficult bells and whistles deferred to a second
    version. We'd like our students to know how to test prototypes with end-users
    and refine their application design once or twice within even a three-month project.
    When business requirements are extreme, e.g., "build me amazon.com by yourself
    in three months," we want our students to understand how to cope with the challenge
    via automatic code generation and use of open-source toolkits where appropriate.

  zh: 除了学习这些原则，我们希望学生学会一些技能。这是一个实验课程，我们希望毕业的学生能够成为胜任的软件工程师。我们希望我们的学生能够将模糊和雄心勃勃的规范转化为一个可以在几个月内构建和推出的系统设计，首先构建最重要和最容易开发的功能，将困难的花哨功能推迟到第二个版本。我们希望我们的学生知道如何与最终用户测试原型并在一个三个月的项目中一两次完善他们的应用设计。当业务需求极端时，例如，“在三个月内独自构建一个amazon.com”，我们希望我们的学生能够理解如何通过自动生成代码和在适当的情况下使用开源工具包来应对挑战。
- en: We can recast the "student knows how to build amazon.com" statement in terms
    of technologies used. By the time someone has finished reading and doing the exercises

    want to know whether there are any early morning appointments on your calendar
    that would prevent you from staying in the tub and finishing an interesting article.
    You've bought a new DVD player. You could read the manual and master the remote
    control. But in a dark room wouldn't it be easier if you could simply ask the
    house or the machine to "back up 30 seconds"? You're driving in your car and curious
    to know the population of Thailand and the country's size relative to the state
    of California; voice is your only option.

    DVD 播放机。你可以阅读说明书并掌握遥控器。但在黑暗的房间里，如果你可以简单地问房子或机器“后退 30 秒”会不会更容易呢？你正在开车，好奇知道泰国的人口和该国与加利福尼亚州的大小的比例；语音是你唯一的选择。
- en: There are some easy-to-identify missing features in typical Web-based applications.
    For example, shareable and portable sessions. You can use the Internet to share
    your photos. You can use the Internet to share your music. You can use the Internet
    to share your documents. The one thing that you can't typically share on the Internet
    is your experience of using the Internet. Suppose that you're surfing a travel
    site, planning a trip for yourself and three friends. Wouldn't it be nice if your
    companions could see what you're looking at, page by page, and speak comments
    into a shared voice session? If everyone has the same brand of computer and special
    software, this is easy enough. But shareable sessions ought to be a built-in feature
    of sites that are usable from any browser. The same infrastructure could be used
    to make sessions portable. You could start browsing on a desktop computer with
    a big screen and finish your session in a taxi on a mobile phone.

  zh: 在典型的基于Web的应用程序中有一些容易识别的缺失功能。例如，可共享和可移植的会话。你可以使用互联网分享你的照片。你可以使用互联网分享你的音乐。你可以使用互联网分享你的文档。但你通常无法在互联网上分享你使用互联网的体验。假设你正在浏览一个旅行网站，为自己和三个朋友计划一次旅行。如果你的同伴可以看到你一页页浏览的内容，并在共享的语音会话中发表评论，那不是很好吗？如果每个人都有相同品牌的计算机和特殊软件，这是很容易的。但可共享的会话应该是任何浏览器可用的网站的内置功能。同样的基础设施可以用来使会话可移植。你可以在具有大屏幕的台式计算机上开始浏览，然后在出租车上用手机完成你的会话。
- en: Speaking of mobile browsers, their small screens raise the issues of multi-modal
    user interfaces and personalization. With the General Packet Radio Service or
    "GPRS", rolled out across the world in late 2001, it became possible for a mobile
    user to simultaneously speak and listen in a voice connection while using text
    screens delivered via a Web connection. As an engineer, you'll have to decide
    when it makes sense to talk to the user, listen to the user, print out a screen
    of options to the user, and ask the user to highlight and click to choose from
    that screen of options. For example, when booking an airline flight it is much
    more convenient to speak the departure and arrival cities than to choose from
    a menu of thousands of airports worldwide. But if there are ten options for making
    the connection you don't want to wait for the computer to read out those ten and
    you don't want to have to hold all the facts about those ten options in your mind.
    It would be more convenient for the travel service to send you a Web page with
    the ten options printed and scrollable.

  zh: 谈到移动浏览器，它们的小屏幕引发了多模用户界面和个性化的问题。随着全球普及的GPRS（General Packet Radio Service）在2001年末推出，移动用户可以在使用Web连接的同时进行语音通话和听取文本屏幕。作为一名工程师，你需要决定何时与用户交谈，倾听用户，向用户打印选项屏幕，并要求用户在选项屏幕中进行突出显示和选择。例如，在预订航班时，直接说出出发和到达城市比从全球数千个机场的菜单中选择要方便得多。但如果有十个选项可供选择，你不想等待计算机读出这十个选项，也不想记住这十个选项的所有信息。旅行服务向你发送一个包含十个选项的可打印和可滚动的网页会更方便。
- en: On the personalization front, consider the corporate "knowledge sharing" or
    "knowledge management" system. Initially, workers are happy simply to have this
    kind of system in place. But after a few years the system becomes so filled with
    stuff that it is difficult to find anything relevant. Given an organization in
    which one thousand documents are generated every day, wouldn't it be nice to have
    a computer system smart enough to figure out which three are likely to be most
    interesting to you? And display the titles on the three lines of your phone's

    "The Strength of Weak Ties" (American Journal of Sociology 78:1360-80) showed
    that most people got their jobs from people whom they did not know very well.
    Friends of friends of friends, perhaps. There are aggregate social and economic
    advantages to networks of people with a lot of weak ties. These networks have
    much faster information flow than networks in which people stick to their families
    and their villages. If you're exploring a new career or area of interest, you
    want to reach out beyond the people whom you know very well. If you're starting

    Nine to Paradise by Leo Buscaglia". On any subsequent request by Joe Smith, the
    server-side script can simply check the log and display the contents of the shopping
    cart. A problem with this idea, however, is that HTTP is *anonymous*. A Web server
    doesn't know that it is Joe Smith connecting. The server only knows the IP address
    of the computer making the request. Sometimes this translates into a host name.
    If it is joe-smiths-desktop.stanford.edu, perhaps you can identify subsequent
    requests from this IP address as coming from the same person. But what if it is
    cache-rr02.proxy.aol.com, one of the HTTP proxy servers connecting America Online's
    20 million users to the public Internet? The same user's next request will very
    likely come from a different IP address, i.e., another physical computer within
    AOL's racks and racks of proxy machines. The next request from cache-rr02.proxy.aol.com

    back. All changes take effect, or none do. Suppose that a user is registering
    by uploading name, address, and JPEG portrait into three separate tables. A Web
    script tells the database to perform three inserts as part of a transaction. If
    the hard drive fills up after the name and address have been inserted but before
    the portrait can be stored, the changes to the name and address tables will be
    rolled back.

    is legal only if it obeys user-defined integrity constraints. Illegal transactions
    aren't allowed and, if an integrity constraint can't be satisfied, the transaction
    is rolled back. For example, suppose that you define a rule that postings in a
    discussion forum table must be attributed to a valid user ID. Then you hire Joe
    Novice to write some admin pages. Joe writes a delete-user page that doesn't bother
    to check whether or not the deletion will result in an orphaned discussion forum
    posting. An ACID-compliant DBMS will check, though, and abort any transaction
    that would result in you having a discussion forum posting by a deleted user.

    there will be a portrait for every user and will present a broken image if there
    is not. Jane Newuser is registering at your site at the same time that Bill Olduser
    is viewing the new user page. The script processing Jane's registration has completed
    inserting her name and address into their respective tables. But it is not done
    storing her JPEG portrait. If Bill's query starts before Jane's transaction commits,

    In Oracle, readers never wait for writers and writers never wait for readers.
    Suppose the publisher at a large site starts a query at 12:00 PM summarizing usage
    by user. Oracle might have to spend an hour sifting through 200 GB of tracking
    data. The disk drives grind and one CPU is completely used up until 1:30 PM. Further
    suppose that User #356712 comes in at 12:30 PM and changes his email address,
    thus updating a row in the `users` table. If the usage tracking query arrives
    at this row at 12:45 PM, Oracle will notice that the row was last modified after
    the query started. Under the "I" in ACID, Oracle is required to isolate the publisher
    from the user''s update. Oracle does this by reaching into the rollback segment
    and producing data from user row #356712 as it was at 12:00 PM when the query
    started. Here''s the scenario in a table:'

    PM进来，并在12:30 PM更改了他的电子邮件地址，从而更新了`users`表中的一行。如果使用情况跟踪查询在12:45 PM到达此行，Oracle将注意到此行在查询开始后最后一次修改。根据ACID中的"I"，Oracle需要将发布者与用户的更新隔离开来。Oracle通过进入回滚段并从用户行#356712在12:00

- en: There are several interesting things about this program, which was built by
    one of the authors in 1995\. One is that it was enabled by the existence of a
    procedure built into AOLserver that went out and grabbed a page from the wider
    Internet, `ns_httpget`. This enabled the entire project to be completed in one
    hour. Engineering is all about cost. If building this little application would
    have required several days of work it probably would not have been done. A second
    item worth noting is that the program has required substantial maintenance over
    the years, far exceeding its initial development cost. The program relies on using
    regular expressions to pull data out of HTML pages that are designed for human
    eyes. As the publishers of the underlying data sources have changed their HTML
    formatting over the years, these regular expressions have had to be updated.

  zh: 这个程序有几个有趣的地方，它是由其中一位作者在1995年构建的。其中一个有趣的地方是，它是通过AOLserver内置的一个程序`ns_httpget`来抓取互联网上的页面而实现的。这使得整个项目在一个小时内完成。工程学关乎成本。如果构建这个小应用程序需要几天的工作，那么可能就不会完成。另一个值得注意的地方是，这个程序在多年来需要大量的维护，远远超过了最初的开发成本。该程序依赖于使用正则表达式从为人类眼睛设计的HTML页面中提取数据。随着基础数据源的发布者多年来改变他们的HTML格式，这些正则表达式必须不断更新。
- en: The final point worth mentioning about this program is that part of the hour
    of coding went into building a general-purpose caching or *memoization* system
    to record the results of evaluating any Tcl expression in a global variable. Why?
    It seemed like bad netiquette to write a program that had the potential to impose
    an unreasonable load on the Census Bureau and stock quote servers. Also, in the
    event that the Wealth Clock became popular it would be asking the underlying servers
    several times a second for the same data. Lastly it seemed that users shouldn't
    have to wait for the two subsidiary pages to be fetched if they didn't need up-to-the-minute
    data. With the complete HTML page stored in a global variable, it is available
    from AOLserver's virtual memory space and can be accessed much faster than even
    a static file. Users who want a real-time answer can demand one with an extra
    mouse click. The calculation performed for them then updates the cache for casual
    users.

  zh: 关于这个程序值得一提的最后一点是，编码的一部分用于构建一个通用的缓存或*记忆化*系统，以记录评估任何Tcl表达式的结果并存储在全局变量中。为什么？因为编写一个有可能对人口普查局和股票报价服务器施加不合理负载的程序似乎是不礼貌的。此外，如果财富时钟变得受欢迎，它将每秒向基础服务器请求多次相同的数据。最后，似乎用户不应该等待两个子页面被获取，如果他们不需要实时数据。将完整的HTML页面存储在全局变量中，可以从AOLserver的虚拟内存空间中更快地访问，甚至比静态文件还要快。想要实时答案的用户可以通过额外的鼠标点击要求。然后为他们执行的计算会更新缓存以供普通用户使用。
- en: The caching mechanism might sound like overengineering but from time to time
    the Wealth Clock would be linked to from extremely popular news sites and receive
    several requests per second. The ability to handle a reasonably high load like
    that, back in the mid-1990s, without an enormous server farm was rather rare.
    Had those requests been passed directly through to the Census Bureau, for example,
    the entire service would have slowed to a crawl.

- en: This exercise exists because we found that, when faced with the task of moving
    data from one table to another, programmers were dragging the data across SQL*Net
    from Oracle into their Web server, manipulating it in a Web script, then pushing
    it back into Oracle over SQL*Net. This is not the way! SQL is a very powerful
    language and there is no need to bring in any other tools if what you want to
    do is move data around within the RDBMS.

    is uploading and downloading photos, participating in discussions, reading tutorials,
    shopping for equipment, etc. The same person may connect via a mobile phone, in
    which case he or she becomes a **mobile user**. If the mobile user is in the middle
    of a photographic project, we want to provide information about nearby camera
    shops, processing labs, repair shops, time of sunset, good locations, and other
    useful data. If the mobile user is connecting for social purposes, we need to

    technology. A ".pl", ".asp", ".php", ".adp", or ".tcl" indicates the use of a

    DNS is a distributed application in that there is no single computer that holds
    translations for all possible hostnames. A domain registrar, e.g., [register.com](http://www.register.com),
    records that the domain servers for the google.com domain are at particular IP
    addresses. A user's local *name server* will query the name servers for google.com
    to find the translation for the hostname `www.google.com`. Note that there is
    nothing magic about "www"; it is merely a conventional name for a computer that
    runs a Web server. The procedure for translating a hostname such as [`froogle.google.com`](http://froogle.google.com/)

    in negotiating intellectual property rights. If you give away all rights to everything
    that you produce as a "work for hire", you won't have a personal toolkit of software
    that you can reuse on new projects. If you don't give away any rights, nobody
    will be able to run your software, which probably means that you won't be able

- en: During this course, for example, you will ideally want to retain ownership of
    all software that you produce. You will therefore be free to reuse the code in
    any way, shape, or form. The client, however, is going to be putting in a lot
    of time and effort working with you over a period of months and is thus entitled
    to some benefit. Your university tuition payments have probably drained away all
    of the cash in your bank account and therefore you won't be giving the client
    money as compensation for his or her time. What you can do is give the client
    a license to use your software. This obviously benefits the client but it also
    benefits you. The more people that are out there happily running your software
    the better your professional resume looks.

    people are, the better the opportunity for building a community out of an aggregate.
    An environment where anonymous users shout at each other from behind screen names
    isn't worth the programming and system administration effort. The user database
    should have a facility for recording the reliability of a user's name and email
    address since the name is likely to become more reliably known over time and the

    should be able to store a personal URL for each user. If this is a Yahoo! Geocities
    page it won't contribute too much to accountability and identification. On the
    other hand, if the URL starts with "http://research.hp.com/personal/" it will
    give other users some confidence. Since one of the sad features of the Web as
    architected in 1990 is that URLs rot, a user database needs an extra field to
    keep track of what has happened when a robot tries to visit the recorded URL.
    If a URL has not been reachable on several separate occasions over a one-week
    period, it is probably safe for a computer program to assume that the URL is out
    of date and stop displaying it publicly.

    It is up to the programmer to count the Nth occurrence of the ? in a SQL string

    if the SQL statement contains fifteen or more variables, a very common situation
    in real applications. You can also imagine the possibilities for introducing subtle

    947 collected from a particular field in Montana is a member of species X or species

    tree for the various species. If you were to eavesdrop on a cocktail party in

    illusory. There is widespread disagreement on what constitutes the correct taxonomy.

    require more training than is practical for casual users. For example, RCS mandates
    explicit check-out and check-in. While a file is checked out by User A it is locked
    and nobody but User A can check it back in. Suppose that User A goes out to lunch,
    but there is some important news that absolutely must be put on the site. What
    if User A leaves for a two-week vacation and forgets to check a bunch of files
    back in? These problems can be worked around manually, but it becomes a challenge

- en: There are two classical ways to implement an audit trail in an RDBMS. The first
    is to set up separate audit tables, one for each production table. Every time
    an update is made to a production table, the old row is written out to an audit
    table, with a time stamp. This can be accomplished transparently via RDBMS triggers,
    which are described in the "Triggers" chapter of SQL for Web Nerds at [http://philip.greenspun.com/sql/triggers](http://philip.greenspun.com/sql/triggers)
    and demonstrated in practice in an open-source audit trail package documented
    at [http://philip.greenspun.com/seia/examples-content-management/audit-acs-doc](examples-content-management/audit-acs-doc).
    The second classical approach is to keep current and archived information in the
    same table. This is more expensive in terms of computing resources required because
    the information that you want for the live site is interspersed with seldom-retrieved
    archived information. But it is easier if you want to program in the capability
    to show the site as it was on a particular day. Your templates won't have to query
    a different table, they will merely need a different WHERE clause.

  zh: 在关系数据库管理系统（RDBMS）中实现审计跟踪的两种经典方法。第一种是设置单独的审计表，每个生产表对应一个。每次对生产表进行更新时，旧行将写入审计表，并附有时间戳。这可以通过RDBMS触发器透明地完成，触发器在[http://philip.greenspun.com/sql/triggers](http://philip.greenspun.com/sql/triggers)的“触发器”章节中有描述，并在一个开源审计跟踪包中实践演示，文档在[http://philip.greenspun.com/seia/examples-content-management/audit-acs-doc](examples-content-management/audit-acs-doc)。第二种经典方法是将当前和归档信息保存在同一表中。这在计算资源方面更昂贵，因为您想要的用于实时站点的信息与很少检索的归档信息交错在一起。但是，如果您想要编程实现在特定日期显示站点的功能，则更容易。您的模板不必查询不同的表，只需一个不同的WHERE子句。
- en: Michael Stonebraker, a professor at University of California Berkeley, looked
    at this problem around 1990 and decided to build an RDBMS with, among other advanced
    features, native support for versioning. This became the PostgreSQL open-source
    RDBMS. The original PostgreSQL had a "no-overwrite architecture" in which a change
    to a row resulted in a complete new version of that row being written out to the
    disk. Thus the hard disk drive contained all previous versions of every row in
    the table. A programmer could `select * from content_table['epoch','1995-01-01']
    ...` to get all versions from the beginning of time ("epoch") until January 1,
    1995\. This innovation made for some nice articles in academic journals, but execrable
    transaction processing performance. The modern PostgreSQL scrapped this idea in
    favor of Oracle-style write-ahead logging in which only updates are written to
    the hard drive (see the "Write-Ahead Logging" chapter of the PostgreSQL documentation
    at [http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/wal.html](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/wal.html)).

    * from content_table['epoch','1995-01-01'] ...`来获取从时间开始（“epoch”）到1995年1月1日的所有版本。这一创新在学术期刊中发表了一些不错的文章，但交易处理性能很差。现代的PostgreSQL放弃了这个想法，转而采用了Oracle风格的预写式日志，只有更新会写入硬盘（请参阅PostgreSQL文档中的“预写式日志”章节，网址为[http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/wal.html](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/wal.html))。

    What if we remove the primary key constraint? In Oracle this prevents us from
    establishing referential integrity constraints pointing to this ID. With no integrity
    constraints, we will be running the risk, for example, that our database will
    contain comments on content items that have been deleted. With multiple rows for
    each content item, our pointers become ambiguous. The statement "User 739 has
    read Article 5657" points from a specific row in the `users` table into a set
    of rows in the `content_raw`. Should we try to be more specific? Do we want a
    comment on an article to refer to a specific version of that article? Do we want
    to know that a reader has read a specific version of an article? Do we want to
    know that an editor has approved a specific version of an article? It depends.
    For some purposes, we probably do want to point to a version, e.g., for approval,
    and at other times we want to point to the article in the abstract. If we add

    working from his or her own directory. This makes sense because there is no persistence
    in the C world. Code is compiled. A binary runs that builds data structures in
    RAM. When the program terminates, it doesn't leave anything behind. The entire
    "tree" of software is checked out from a version control repository into the file
    system of the development computer. Changed files are checked back into the repository
    when the programmer is satisfied.

    Internet applications is that it becomes very tedious to make a small change.
    The programmer checks out the tree onto a development server. The programmer installs
    an RDBMS, then creates an RDBMS user and a tablespace. The programmer exports
    the RDBMS from the production site into a dump file, transfers that dump file
    over the network to the development machine, and imports it into the RDBMS installation
    on the development server. Keep in mind that for many Internet applications the
    database may approach one terabyte in size, and therefore it could take hours
    or days to transfer and import the dump file. Finally, the programmer finds a
    free IP address or port and sets up an HTTP server rooted at the development tree.

    Some Web servers can be configured or reprogrammed to log the total time spent
    serving a page. By looking at the times spent serving large photographs, for example,
    you can infer average bandwidth available between your server and the users. If
    the tenth percentile users are getting 50 Kbits per second, you know that, even
    if your server were infinitely fast at preparing pages, you should try to make
    sure that your pages, with graphics, are either no larger than 50 Kbits in size
    or that the HTML is designed such that the page will render incrementally. (A
    page that is one big TABLE is bad; a page in which any images have WIDTH and HEIGHT
    tags is good because the text will be rendered immediately with blank spaces that
    will be gradually filled in as the images are loaded.)

    a blank text entry box and no hint, expecting the user to type MM/DD/YYYY, e.g.,
    09/28/1963 for September 28, 1963\. If the user''s input did not match this pattern
    or the date did not exist, e.g., 02/30/2002, the application returns a page explaining
    the requirements. A minor improvement would be to add a note next to the box:
    "MM/DD/YYYY". If the application logs showed that the number of error pages served
    was reduced, but not eliminated, perhaps defaulting the text entry box to today''s
    date in MM/DD/YYYY format would be better. Surf over to your favorite travel site,

    two places where procedural abstractions, i.e., fragments of programs that are
    shared by multiple pages, can be developed. Modern relational database management
    systems can interpret Turing-complete imperative programming languages such as
    C#, Java, and PL/SQL. Thus any computation that could be performed by any computer
    could, in principle, be performed by a program running inside an RDBMS such as
    Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, or PostgreSQL. In other words, you don't need a
    Web server or any other tools but could implement page scripting and an HTTP server

    advantages to be had in splitting off the presentation layer of an application
    into a set of separate physical computers. Thus our page scripts will most definitely
    reside outside of the RDBMS. This gives us the opportunity to write additional
    software that will run within or close to the Web server program, typically in
    the same computer language that is used for page scripting, in the form of *shared
    procedures*. In the case of a PHP script, for example, a shared procedure could
    be an include file. In the case of a site where individual pages are scripted
    in Java or C#, a shared procedure might be some classes and methods used by multiple
    pages.

    two files for each URL. File 1 contains SQL statements and some procedural code
    that fills local variables or a data structure with information from the RDBMS.
    The last statement in File 1 is a call to a procedure that will fetch File 2,
    a template file that looks like standard HTML with simple references to data prepared
    in File 1.

    File 2 will be named `index.template`. In preparing a template, a designer needs
    to know (a) the names of the variables being set in index.pl, (b) that one references
    a variable from the template with a dollar sign, e.g., `$standard_navbar`, and
    (c) that to send an actual dollar sign or at-sign character to the user it should
    be escaped with a backslash. The merging of the template and local variables established
    in index.pl can be accomplished with a single call to Perl's built-in `eval` procedure,
    which performs standard Perl string interpolation, i.e., replacing `$foo` with
    the value of the variable `foo`.

    the same directory, there is always a risk that a careless designer will delete,
    rename, or modify a computer program. It may make more sense to establish a separate
    directory and give the designers permission only on that parallel tree. For example
    on photo.net you might have the page scripts in `/web/photonet/www/` and templates
    underneath `/web/photonet/templates/`. A script at `/e-commerce/checkout.tcl`
    finishes by calling the shared procedure `return_template`. This procedure first
    invokes the Web server API to find out what URI is being served. A configuration
    parameter specifies the start of the templates tree. `return_template` uses the
    URL plus the template tree root to probe in the file system for a template to
    evaluate. If found, the template, in AOLserver ADP format (same syntax as Microsoft
    ASP), is evaluated in the context of `return_template`'s caller, which means that
    local variables set in the script will be available to the ADP file.

    permissioning, it may seem natural to store templates in a database table. These
    templates can then be edited from a browser, and changes to templates can be managed
    as part of a site's overall publishing workflow. If the information architecture
    of a site is represented explicitly in RDBMS tables (see [the Content Management
    chapter](content-management)), it may be natural to keep templates and template
    fragments in the database along with content types, categories, and subcategories.

    all of the templates in its virtual memory for maximum speed. The reason that

    subject summary lines, etc., where there is no value to having an HTML tag. For
    some longer documents obtained from users, however, it might be nice to enable
    them to use a restricted set of HTML tags such as B, I, EM, P, BR, UL, LI, etc.
    If you're going to store HTML in the database once and serve it back out thousands
    of times per day, it is better to check for legal tags at upload time. The problem
    with checking for disallowed tags such as SCRIPT, DIV, and FONT is that HTML keeps
    getting extended in de jure and de facto ways. Unless you want the responsibility
    of keeping current with all of the ways in which new HTML tags can make browsers
    behave, it may be better to check for approved tags. Either way, you'll want the
    allowed or disallowed tags list to be kept in an easy-to-modify configuration
    file. Further, you probably want to perform a bit of validation on the use of
    allowed tags such as B or I. A user who makes a mistake and forgets to close one
    of these tags might render 100 comments underneath in an unusual font style.

    among human beings. User A can post a question. User B can post an answer. User
    C can view both question and answer and learn from the exchange. In a *threaded*
    forum, User D has the choice of posting a response to User A's question or to
    User B's response. In a *Q&A format* forum, Users D, E, and F can post responses
    to User A's question, and the responses will simply be presented in the order
    that they were submitted. With minor tweaks to the presentation layer, a discussion
    forum system can function as a personal commentable weblog.

    and is also known to old people as "NetNews" and to young people as "Google Groups".
    Each newsgroup is a more or less self-contained community of people interested
    in a particular topic, collaborating through a threaded discussion forum. A good
    example is [`rec.aviation.soaring`](http://groups.google.com/groups?q=rec.aviation.soaring&hl=en),
    where people talk about flying around in airplanes without engines.

    expert. Keep in mind that the number of people using a group such as `rec.aviation.soaring`
    is fairly small—most people get nervous in little planes and even more nervous
    in a little plane with no engine. An analysis of October 2004's activity by Marc
    Smith's Netscan service ([netscan.research.microsoft.com](http://netscan.research.microsoft.com))
    shows that the group had only 174 "Returnees". Thus it will be fairly straightforward
    for these core users to recognize each other by name or email address. A typical
    magnet content posting in a newsgroup is the FAQ or frequently asked questions
    summary in which each question has an agreed-upon-by-the-group-experts answer.

    to divide the effort of moderating a single forum among multiple moderators was
    non-existent, and the news protocols had security holes that let commercial spam
    messages through even on moderated groups. For an overview of the circa 2001 state

    especially if your discussion forum is supporting an organized class. The Berkman
    Center at Harvard Law School (HLS) was a pioneer in this area. The teachers at
    HLS weren't happy with the bias in favor of early responders inherent in a standard
    discussion forum system. The first response to a question gets the most readers
    because it is near the top of the page, so it might be more ego-gratifying to
    be first than to spend more time crafting a thoughtful response. This shortcoming
    was addressed by writing what they call a *semi-synchronous* discussion forum.
    Responses are collected for a period of time, but not made public until the deadline
    for responses is reached. The system is called the Rotisserie.

    participants to respond to postings. For example, every student in a class will
    be required to post an essay in response to a question. After a deadline lapses,
    those essays are made public. The Rotisserie then assigns to each participant
    the task of responding to a particular essay. Every student must write an essay.
    Every essay gets a response. A particularly good or controversial essay might
    get additional responses. A particularly loudmouthed participant might elect to
    respond to many essays.

    we have a headline asking "What is Different about Discussion?" above the suggestion
    that the `content_raw` table can be used to support forum questions and answers.
    If you went down that route and were implementing the mentoring user experience,
    this is where discussion would diverge a bit from the rest of the content on the
    site. You need a way to represent in the database management system whether a
    discussion forum question is open or closed. If you add a `discussion_forum_question_status`
    column to the `content_raw` table you'll have a NULL column value whenever the
    content item is not a discussion forum question. That's not very clean. You may
    also be adding a `closed_question_p` boolean column to indicate that a forum posting
    had been identified by the original questioner as having answered the question.
    This will be NULL for more than 99 percent of content items. That's not a storage

    the `discussion_question_status` table to figure out what percentage of those
    were marked as closing the question. In practice, you'd probably want to maintain
    a denormalized metric as an extra column or columns in the `users` table, perhaps

    of communication, the user receives asynchronously from a server robot or a fellow
    community member. Desktop users will recognize email alerts and instant messaging
    as applications of this mode. Two key requirements for asynchronous, user-bound
    communication are (a) the user must be addressable, e.g. by an email address or
    a screen name, and (b) the user must be running software that is listening on
    their behalf, e.g. a mail server or an instant messaging client. These capabilities

    messages through the email system. The phone's "email address" is formed by appending
    a provider-specific domain to the phone's voice number. So if John's Verizon Wireless
    phone number is 617-555-1212, we can alert him by sending email to `6175551212@vtext.com`.

    means of Internet access in Japan. We think that two reasons explain i-mode''s
    relative success: always-on connectivity and revenue opportunities for publishers.'

    of as long as two minutes for the first page; with the always-on i-mode system,
    the user gets consistent performance and relatively quick results for initial
    requests. Early Western mobile systems charged per minute, which was painful for
    users who typed text slowly on numeric keypads and received pages at 9800 baud.
    Always-on systems such as i-mode tend to charge a per-byte or flat per-month rate
    for access, which greatly reduces the possibility of a huge end-of-month bill.

- en: In most mobile Internet systems, the phone company decides what sites are going
    to be interesting to users and places them on a set of default bookmarks. The
    phone company often charges the site publisher to be promoted to its customers.
    The result? Every early system in the U.S. made it easy to connect to amazon.com
    and shop for books, which turned out not to be a popular activity. DoCoMo, the
    Japanese company that runs the i-mode service, took a different approach. DoCoMo
    decided that they weren't creative enough to figure out what consumers would want
    out of the mobile Internet. They therefore came up with a system in which content
    providers are more or less equally available. Content providers can earn revenue
    via banner advertisements or by charging for premium content. When a provider
    wants to charge, DoCoMo handles the payment, taking a 5-9 percent commission.

    i-mode is in Japan? The first ray of hope was provided by General Packet Radio
    Service (GPRS). GPRS takes advantage of lulls in voice traffic within a cell to
    deliver a theoretically maximum of 160Kbits/second via unused frequencies at any
    particular moment. GPRS requires new handsets that are equipped to listen simultaneously
    on both the dedicated circuit-switched connection in use for a voice call and
    also monitor GPRS frequencies for incoming packets. In practice, GPRS may provide
    only three or four times faster throughput than existing WAP systems. More important
    is the fact that GPRS can, in theory, deliver an "always-on" experience similar
    to that of i-mode or a hardwired desktop computer.

    to have as few and as simple servers as possible. Consider your desktop PC, for
    example. How long has it been since the hardware failed? If you look into a room
    with 50 simple PCs or single-board workstations, how often do you see one that
    is unavailable due to hardware failure? Suppose, however, that you combine computers
    to support your application. If one machine is 99 percent reliable, a site that
    depends on 10 such machines will be only 0.99^(10) reliable or 90 percent. The
    probability analysis here is the same as flipping coins but with a heavy 0.99
    bias towards heads. You need to get 10 heads in a row in order to have a working
    service. What if you needed 100 machines to be up and running? That's only going

    talks to multiple clients simultaneously. If Client A updates a record in the
    database and, a split-second later, Client B requests that record, the RDBMS is
    required to deliver the updated information to Client B. If we were to spread
    the RDBMS server program across multiple physical computers, it is possible that
    Client A would be served from Computer I and Client B would be served from Computer
    II. A database transaction cannot be committed unless it has been written out
    to the hard disk drive. Thus all that these computers need do is check the disk
    for updates before returning any results to Client B. Disk drives are 100,000
    times slower than RAM. A single computer running an RDBMS keeps an up-to-date
    version of the commonly used portions of the database in RAM. So our multi-computer
    RDBMS server that ensures database coherency across processors via reference to
    the hard disk will start out 100,000 times slower than a single-computer RDBMS
    server.

    boards and cables that achieve memory bus speeds.

    single box server? Absolutely. CPU I is serving Client A. CPU II is serving Client
    B. The two CPUs need to apprise each other of database updates. They do this by
    writing into the multiprocessor machine's shared RAM. It turns out that the CPU-CPU
    bandwidth available on typical high-end servers circa 2002 is 100 Gbits/second,
    which is 100 times faster than the fastest available Gigabit Ethernet, FireWire,

    the answer is "no". These procedures are not sufficiently CPU-intensive to make
    splitting them off onto a separate computer worthwhile in terms of system administration
    effort and increased vulnerability to hardware failure. What's more, these procedures
    often do not even warrant a new execution environment. Most procedures in the
    abstraction layer of an Internet service require intimate access to relational
    database tables. That access is fastest when the procedures are running inside
    the RDBMS itself. All modern RDBMSes provide for the execution of standard procedural
    languages within the database server. This trend was pioneered by Oracle with
    PL/SQL and then Java. With the latest Microsoft SQL Server one can supposedly
    run any .NET-supported computer language inside the database.

    is a stateless protocol. Somewhere the server needs to remember things such as
    "Registered User 137 wants to see pages in the French language", "Unregistered
    user who started Session 6781205 has placed the hardcover edition of [The Cichlid
    Fishes](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0738205281/pgreenspun-20) in his
    or her shopping cart." In a multi-process multi-computer server farm, it is impossible
    to guarantee that a particular user will always be returned to the same running
    computer program, if for no other reason than you want the user experience to
    be robust to failure of an individual physical computer. If session state is being
    kept anywhere other than in a cookie or the persistence layer (RDBMS), your application
    server programs will need to communicate with each other constantly to make sure
    that their ad hoc database is coherent. In that case, it might make sense to get
    an expensive multi-CPU machine to support the application server. However, if
    all the layers are stateless except for the persistence layer, the application
    server layer can be handled by multiple cheap one-CPU machines. At orbitz.com,
    for example, racks of cheap computers are loaded with identical local copies of
    the fare and schedule database. Each time a user clicks to see the options for

    is one layer up from the basic unreliable Internet Protocol (IP). What TCP adds
    is reliability: if a packet of data is not acknowledged, it will be retransmitted.
    Neither TCP nor the IP of the 1990s, IPv4, provides any encryption of the data
    being transmitted. Thus anyone able to monitor the packets on the local-area network
    of the server or client or on the backbone routers may be able to learn, for example,

    of handling 330 SSL connections per second. Finally it is possible to interpose

    to provide that translation to all of its more than 20 million customers. Another
    problem with round-robin DNS is the impact on users when a front-end machine dies.
    If the box at 207.25.71.29 were to fail, none of AOL's customers would be able
    to reach www.cnn.com until the expiration time on the translation had elapsed—the

    worldwide, but not to those users who'd received an unlucky DNS translation to
    the dead machine. For a typical domain, this period of time might be anywhere
    from 6 hours to 1 week. CNN, aware of this problem, could shorten the expiration
    and "minimum time-to-live" on cnn.com but if these were cut down to, say, 30 seconds,
    the load on CNN's name servers might start approaching the intensity of the load
    on its Web servers. Nearly every user page request would be preceded by a request

    is the IP address of photo.net's load balancer. The load balancer accepts the
    TCP connection on port 80 and waits for the Web client to provide a request line,

    page scripts. The router also provides some protection against denial-of-service
    attacks. If a Web server is configured to spawn a maximum of 100 simultaneous
    threads, a malicious user can effectively shut down the site simply by opening
    100 TCP connections to the server and then never sending a request line. The load

    The load balancer can periodically pull load and health information from the front-end
    servers and send each incoming request to the least busy server. The load balancer
    can inspect the URI requested and route to a particular server, for example, sending
    any request that starts with "/discuss/" to the Windows machine that is running
    the discussion forum software. The load balancer can keep a table of where previous

    required are two identical load balancers and cooperation with the next routing
    link in the chain that connects your server farm to the public Internet. Those
    upstream routers must know how to route requests for the same IP address to one
    or the other load balancer depending upon which is up and running. What keeps
    this from becoming an endless spiral of load balancing is that the upstream routers
    aren't actually looking into the TCP packets to find the GET request. They're
    doing the much simpler job of IP routing.

- en: Ensuring failover from a broken RDBMS server is a more difficult challenge and
    one where a large variety of ideas has been tried and found wanting. The first
    idea is to make sure that the RDBMS server never fails. The machine will have
    three power supplies, only two of which are required. Each disk drive will be
    mirrored. If a CPU board fails, the operating system will gracefully fail back
    to running on the remaining CPUs. There will be several network cards. There will
    be two paths to each disk drive. Considering the number of moving parts inside,
    the big complex servers are remarkably reliable, but they aren't 100 percent reliable.
  id: totrans-1791

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Given that a single big server isn't reliable enough, we can buy a whole bunch
    of them and plug them all into the same disk subsystem, then run something like
    Oracle Parallel Server. Database clients connect to whichever physical server
    machine is available. If they can't get a response from a particular server, the
    client retries after a few seconds to another physical server. Thus an RDBMS server
    machine that fails causes the return of errors to any in-process user requests
    being handled by that machine and perhaps a few seconds of interrupted or slow
    service for users who've been directed to the clients of that down machine, but
    it causes no longer term site unavailability.

- en: 'As discussed in the "Persistence Layer" section of this chapter, this approach
    entails a lot of wasted CPU time and bandwidth as the physical machines keep each
    other apprised of database updates. A compromise approach introduced by Oracle
    in 2000 was to configure a two-node parallel server. The first machine would process
    online transactions. The second machine would be allowed to lag as much as, say,
    ten minutes behind the first in terms of updates. If you wanted a CPU-intensive
    report querying last month''s user activity, you''d talk to the backup machine.
    If Machine #1 failed, however, Machine #2 would notice almost immediately and
    start rolling its own state forward from the transaction log on the hard disk.
    Once Machine #2 was up to date with the last committed transaction, it would begin
    offering service as the primary database server. Oracle proudly stated that, for
    customers willing to spend twice as much for RDBMS server hardware, the two-node
    failover configuration was "only a little bit slower" than a single machine.'

    the system unless they are an employee or a registered student and, in the online

    is at odds with the practicalities of running a public online community. For example,
    would it be practical to schedule face-to-face meetings with each potential registrant
    of photo.net, where the new user would show an ID? On the other hand, as discussed
    in the "User Registration and Management" chapter, we can take a stab at authentication
    in a public online community by requiring email verification and by requiring
    alternative authentication for people with Hotmail-style email accounts. In both
    public and private communities, we can enhance accountability simply by making
    each user's name a hyperlink to the complete record of their contributions to

    make it easy to broadcast your ideas to everyone else in the service, but without

    rank writes scripts to insert content all around the Internet with hyperlinks
    to his client''s Web site. The programs are sophisticated enough to work through
    the new user registration pages in your community, registering 100 new accounts
    each with a unique name and email address. The programmer has also set up robots
    to respond to email address verification messages sent by your software. Now you''ve
    got 100 new (fake) users each of whom has posted two messages. If the programmer
    has been a bit sloppy, it is conceivable that all of the user registrations and
    content were posted from the same IP address in which case you could defend against
    this kind of attack by adding an `originating_ip_address` column to your content
    management tables and building an admin page letting you view and potentially
    delete all content from a particular IP address. Discovering this problem after
    the fact, you might deal with it by writing an admin page that would summarize
    the new user registrations and contributions with a checkbox bulk-nuke capability
    to remove those users and all of their content. After cleaning out the spam you''d
    probably add a "verify that you''re a human" step in the user registration process
    in which, for example, a hard-to-read word was obscured inside a patterned bitmap
    image and the would-be registrant had to recognize the word amidst the noise and

    rows that contain some of the query terms. We might need to use OR, a scoring
    function, and an ORDER BY so that the rows containing both query terms are returned
    first. If we insist on the AND clause, we've created a situation in which the
    more the user tells us about her interests the fewer documents we'll return in
    response to a search, eventually returning "0 results found" if she keeps adding
    words. (Note that public search engines circa 2005, such as Google, Yahoo, A9,
    and MSN, *do* implicitly use AND and *do* return 0 results if a user keeps adding
    words to a query and there aren't any documents in the database that contain each

    time that does not vary with the size of the *corpus* indexed. If there are 10
    million documents in the corpus, a search through those 10 million documents will
    not take much longer than a search through a corpus of 1000 documents. (Getting

    of words in standard English. So, for example, the appearance of "resemble" is
    more interesting than "happy" because "resemble" occurs less frequently in standard
    English. Stopwords such as "is" are thrown away altogether. *Stemming* is another
    useful refinement. In the index and in queries we convert all words to their stems.
    The stem word for "families", for example, is "family". With stemming, a query
    for "families" would match a document containing "family" and vice versa.

    documents that are similar to this one" or "Show me documents whose histogram
    is closest to a user-entered string." The inter-document similarity query can
    be handled by comparing histograms already stored in the text database. The search
    string "platinum mines in New Zealand" might be processed first by throwing away
    the stopwords "in" and "new". By using histogram comparison, the software would
    deliver articles that that have the most occurrences of "platinum", "mines", and
    "Zealand". Suppose that "Zealand" is a rarer word than "platinum". Then a document
    with one occurrence of "Zealand" is favored over one with one occurrence of "platinum".
    A document with one occurrence of each word is preferred to an article where only
    one of those words shows up. A document that contains *only* the words "platinum
    mines Zealand" is a better match than a document that contains 100,000 words,
    three of which happen to match the query terms.

    collection are being kept. In an age of $200 disk drives of absurdly high capacity,
    this isn't a powerful argument. It is nearly impossible to fill a modern disk
    drive with words typed by humans. One can fill up a disk drive with video or audio
    streams, but not text. And in any case some full-text search systems can build
    an index to a document collection without themselves keeping the original document
    around, i.e., you would in fact have only one copy of the document in the RDBMS.
  id: totrans-1956

- en: A second argument against using RDBMS and full-text search systems simultaneously
    is that the collections will get out of sync. If the Web server crashes in the
    middle of an RDBMS transaction, all work is rolled back. If the Web server was
    simultaneously inserting a document into a full-text search system, it is possible
    that the full-text database will contain a document that is not in fact available
    on the main pages of the site—the site being generated from the RDBMS. Alternatively,
    the RDBMS insert might succeed while the full-text insert fails, leading to a
    document that is available on the site, but not searchable. This argument, too,
    ultimately lacks power. It is true that the RDBMS is a convenient and nearly foolproof
    means of managing transactions and concurrency. However, it is not the only way.
    If one were to hire sufficiently careful programmers and sufficiently dedicated
    system and database administrators, it would be possible to keep two databases
    in sync.

    of the `content` table. When a Text index is defined on a table it becomes possible
    to use the `contains` operator in a WHERE clause. The Oracle RDBMS SQL query processor
    is smart enough to know how to use the Text index to answer this query without
    doing a sequential table scan. It is possible to have more than one call to `contains`
    in the same query. Thus the last argument of `contains` is an integer identifying
    the query, in this case "1". It is possible to get a relevance score out in the
    select list or in an ORDER BY clause with the function `score` and an argument

    matching. A user who types "zippy pinhead" into a search engine will expect to
    find documents that contain the phrase "Zippy the Pinhead". This won't happen
    if your script passes the raw user query right through to the `Contains` operator.
    More problematic is what happens when a user types a query string that contains
    characters that Oracle Text treats specially. This can result in an error being
    raised by the SQL query and a "Server Error 500" returned to the user if you don't
    catch the error in your procedural script. It would be nice if Oracle Text had
    a built-in procedure called "ProcessRawQueryFromWebForm" or something. But it

    to be correct, for every 100 correct answers there will be at least three or four
    incorrect ones. Even when the data require no interpretation, there will be typos.
    For example, [a Google search for "rossini 1792-1868"](http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=rossini+1792-1868)
    returned 50,900 documents in February 2005; [a search for "rossini 1792-**1869**"](http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=rossini+1792-1869)
    returned 43 documents. A question-answering system built on top of lightly moderated
    user-authored content will have to exercise the same sort of judgment as do humans:
    How many documents contain Answer A versus Answer B? What is the relative authority
    of conflicting documents? Which of two conflicting documents is more recent?'

    old projects. To what is the new project most similar? Suppose that it took you
    three days to build a discussion forum system, for example, and you're asked to
    build a classified ad system. Both systems need a comparable number of database
    tables. Both systems accept content from users and require some sort of administrator
    approval. If built on the same server that is currently running the discussion
    forum, the classified ad system doesn't require any new software, subsystems,
    or other tools that you haven't already installed and used. Thus it would probably
    be safe to estimate the classified ad system as a three-day project.

    the same order or same way on every flight, and a lot of the stuff doesn't matter
    if you're flying on a sunny day in a well-maintained airplane. Unless the checklists
    and procedures have become a habit, however, the pilot who encounters bad weather
    or mechanical problems has a good chance of dying. People tell themselves "I'm
    being sloppy today because this is an unchallenging flight, but I'll be careful
    when I need to be," but in fact the skills of carefulness aren't very useful unless

    had been connected to the Internet since the 1970s, and transferring data among
    computers was commonplace. Yet the Web brought something really new: the perspective
    of viewing the whole Internet as a single information space, where users accessing

    programs. Although distributed computing has been around for as long as there
    have been computer networks, it's only recently that applications that draw upon
    many interconnected machines as one vast computing medium are being deployed on
    a large scale. What's making this possible are new protocols for distributed computing
    built upon HTTP, and that are designed for *programs interacting with programs*,
    rather than for *people surfing with browsers*.

    of pieces — called *services* in the current jargon — that are spread across many
    different machines, and where the services interact seamlessly and transparently
    to produce an overall effect. While the consequences of this change could be minor,
    it's also possible that they could be as profound as the introduction of the Web.

    a formal description of the callable functions, argument names and types, and
    return value type. Most Internet application development environments provide
    a SOAP toolset that transforms the WSDL file into a set of proxy classes or function
    libraries that can be called as if the service were implemented in the local runtime.
    In Microsoft Visual Studio .NET, this operation is referred to as "Adding a Web
    Reference". If you're not a Microsoft Achiever you might find the "SOAP Implementations"
    links at the end of the chapter useful.

    a separate window using the HTML `target=` syntax for the anchor (`<a`) tag. Novice
    users might become confused, however, as the extra window pops up on their screen
    and they might not know how to use their browser or operating system to get back
    to the Confirm/Edit page. A JavaScript pop-up in a small size might reduce the
    scale of this problem. Another option is to use the dreaded Frames feature of
    HTML, putting the Confirm/Edit page in one frame and the other stuff in another
    frame. When Joe finally decides to Confirm/Edit, the Frames syntax provides a
    mechanism for the server to tell the browser "go back to only one window now".
    A third option is to do a "server-side frame" in which you build pages of the
    form `/forum/confirm-follow-link` in which the full posting with Confirm/Edit
    buttons is carried through and the content of the external or internal link is
    presented inside a single page.

    "the", "and", "or", etc. Whatever full-text search tool that you used in the "Search"

    programming tools. The data model can't represent the information that the users
    need, the application doesn't do what what the users need it to do, and instead
    of writing code, the "engineers" are arguing about Java versus Lisp versus ML
    versus C# versus Perl versus VB. If you want to know why computer programmers
    get paid less than medical doctors, consider the situation of two trauma surgeons
    arriving at an accident scene. The patient is bleeding profusely. If surgeons
    were like programmers, they'd leave the patient to bleed out in order to have
    a really satisfying argument over the merits of two different kinds of tourniquet.

    expert in building HTML pages but had trouble programming SQL. They'd promised
    to launch the elaborately specified system 6 weeks from our first meeting. We
    concluded that many of the features that they wanted could be adapted from the
    source code behind the photo.net online community but that adding the "knowledge
    repository" would require 4 programmers working full-time for 6 weeks. What's
    worse, in looking at the specs we decided that the realized system would be unusably
    complex, especially for busy salespeople.

- en: 'A *knowledge management* or *knowledge sharing* system is a multi-user information
    system enabling users to share *knowledge* about a shared domain of expertise
    or inquiry. What is "knowledge"? One way to answer this question is to spend ten
    years in a university philosophy department''s epistemology group. From the perspective
    of a relational database management system, however, it may be easier to define
    knowledge as "text, authored by a user of the community, to which the user may
    attach a document, photograph, or spreadsheet". Other users can comment on the
    knowledge, submitting text and optional attachments of their own. From this definition,
    it would seem that the discussion forum you built earlier would meet the users''
    needs. Indeed, it is true that an archived-and-indexed question-and-answer forum
    may serve many of the needs of a *community of practice*, a group of people trying
    to solve similar problems who can learn from each others'' experiences. However,
    there are a few features beyond a discussion forum that an organization may request,
    for example the following:'

    know almost everything (old-timers, geniuses, grinds), and a big hump in the middle
    of people who are moderately knowledgeable. The managers of the enterprise ask
    themselves "How much more could we accomplish if all of the people in this enterprise
    were as knowledgeable as the wizards?" Typically, the initial assumption is that
    knowledge is finite and this results in the construction of a system to contain
    a mostly static body of knowledge, to be extracted from the brains of the experts
    and codified into a series of files or database rows. Users quickly discover,
    however, that the situations they are facing are not quite analogous to the situations
    described in the "knowledge base" and the "knowledge management system" comes

    the leaf nodes of a hierarchy to converse amongst themselves. Consider the organization
    depicted in figure 15.1. Suppose that a worker in Singapore has a question that
    could be answered by a worker in Des Moines. The act of finding the coworker and
    getting assistance requires going all the way up the hierarchy to the chief executive
    in London and then back down a different path through the hierarchy to Des Moines.
    This bottleneck could be eliminated by eliminating the hierarchy. However, most
    organizations don't want to eliminate their hierarchies. It is the hierarchy that
    enables the corporation to reduce management complexity by establishing profit-and-loss
    responsibility at intermediate levels. Better to *supplement* the hierarchy with
    an informal mechanism by which the Singapore-based worker can ask for help and
    the Des Moines-based worker can offer it, i.e., a knowledge-sharing system.

    High Frequency Omni Ranging beacons (VORs). These transmit two signals, one of
    which is constant in phase regardless of an airplane's bearing to the VOR. The
    second signal varies in phase as one circles a VOR. Thus a VOR receiver in the
    airplane can compare the phase of the two signals and determine that an airplane
    is, for example, on the 123-degree radial from the VOR. If you didn't have a Global
    Positioning System receiver in your airplane, you'd determine your position on
    the chart by plotting radials out from two VORs. For a navaid, we need to store
    its type (could be an old non-directional beacon, which simply puts out an AM
    radio-style broadcast), frequency, position, and Morse code ID (you want to listen
    to the dot-dash pattern to make sure that you're receiving the proper navaid).

    should display small hyperlinks to edit single fields. All of these links can
    target the URL `object-edit-element` with different arguments. The object display
    page should also summarize all the currently linked objects and have an "add link"
    hyperlink whose target is `link-add`.

    page will display a table of object names with dimensional controls at the top.

    the access logs, but if you need it to show a "member since 2001" annotation as

    your software will update `last_login`. When he or she clicks the "new since last

    but any system in which an HTTP server program can start up a new process in response
    to a Web request presents a security risk. Many Web scripting languages have "exec"
    commands in which the Web server has all of the power of a logged-in user typing
    at a command line. This is a powerful and useful capability, but a malicious user
    might be able to, for example, run a program that will return the username/password
    file for the server.

- en: In the Unix world the most effective solution to this challenge is `chroot`,
    short for *change root*. This command changes the file system root of the Web
    server, and any program started by the Web server, to some other place in the
    file system, e.g., `/web/main-server/`. A program in the directory `/usr/local/bin/`
    can't be executed by the chrooted Web server because the Web server can't even
    describe a file unless its path begins with `/web/main-server/`. The root directory,
    `/`, is now `/web/main-server/`. One downside of this approach is that if the
    Web server needs to run a program in the directory `/usr/local/bin/` it can't.
    The solution is to take all of the utilities, server log analyzers, and other
    required programs and move them underneath `/web/main-server/`, e.g., to `/web/main-server/bin/`.

    out about an error within about one hour. On a high-profile site this might not
    be adequate. It might be worth building error notification into the software itself.
    Serious errors can be caught and the error handler can call a `notify_the_maintainers`
    procedure that sends email. This might be worth including, for example, in a centralized
    facility that allows page scripts to connect to the relational database management
    system (RDBMS). If the RDBMS is unavailable, the sysadmins, dbadmins, and programmers
    ought to be notified immediately so that they can figure out what went wrong and
    bring the system back up.

    record a `last_notification_sent` timestamp in the HTTP server's memory or on
    disk and use it to ignore or accumulate requests for notification that come in,
    say, within 15 minutes of a previous request. A reasonable assumption is that
    a programmer, once alerted, will visit the server and start looking at the full
    error logs. Thus `notify_the_maintainers` need not actually send out information
    about every problem encountered.

    source code files without attribution ("I know who wrote it") and Web pages without
    email signatures ("nobody is actually going to use this"). Maimonides''s commentary
    on Hillel''s quote above is that a person acquires habits of doing right or wrong—virtues
    and vices—while young; youths should do good deeds now, and not wait until adulthood.
    I.e., if you don''t take steps to help other users and programmers now, as a university
    student, there is no reason to believe that you''ll develop habits of virtue post-graduation.
    An alternative way of thinking about this is to ask yourself how you feel when
    you''re stuck trying to use someone else''s Web page and there is no clear way
    to send feedback or get help or how much fun it is to be reading the source code
    for an application and not have any idea who wrote it, why, or where to ask questions.
    Continuing the Talmudic theme of the chapter, keep in mind Hillel''s response
    to a gentile interested in Judaism: "That which is hateful to you, do not do to
    your neighbor. That is the whole Torah; the rest is commentary. Go and study it."'

    the bottom of every page. That's a good start toward building a professional reputation.
    But it isn't enough. For every computer application that you build, you ought
    to prepare an *overview document*. This will be a single HTML page containing
    linear text that can be read simply by scrolling, i.e., the reader need not follow
    any hyperlinks in order to understand your achievement. It is probably reasonable
    to expect that you can hold the average person's attention for four or five screens
    worth of text and illustrations. What to include in the overview illustrations?
    In-line images of Web or mobile browser screens that display the application's
    capabilities. If the application supports a complex workflow, perhaps a graphic
    showing all the states and transitions.

    that for every person reading this chapter a poor villager in India is learning
    SQL and Java. A big salary can evaporate quickly. Between March 2001 and April
    2004 roughly 400,000 American jobs in information technology were eliminated.
    Many of those who had coded Java in obscurity ended up as cab drivers or greeters
    at Walmart. A personal professional reputation, by contrast, is a bit harder to
    build than the big salary but also harder to lose. If you don't invest some time
    in writing (prose, not code), however, you'll never have any reputation outside
    your immediate circle of colleagues, who themselves may end up working at McDonald's
    and be unable to help you get an engineering job during a recession.

    difficult for an individual programmer to have an impact. Software had to be marketed
    via traditional media, burned onto a physical medium, put into a fancy package,
    and shipped to a retailer. Consequently, fifty or more people were involved in
    any piece of code reaching an end-user. It would have been tough for a software
    engineer to aspire to the same standards of professionalism that put Surgeon 3
    over the top. How can the software engineer ensure that his or her innovation
    will ever reach an end-user if shipping it out the door requires fifty other people
    to be paid on an ongoing basis? How can the software engineer teach other programmers
    how to practice the innovation if the software is closed-source and his or her
    organization's employment agreements mandate secrecy?

    lab at a university where, very likely, he or she would be permitted to teach
    others via publication, source code release, and face-to-face instruction of students.
    However, by going into a university, where the required team of fifty would never
    be assembled to deliver a software product to market, the programmer was giving
    up the opportunity to work at the state of the art as well as innovate and teach.

    challenge quantified. The chief information officer from a large enterprise wanted
    to know how many hours went into development of the application that he was seeing
    and how many tables were in the data model. He was beyond the point in his career
    when he was writing his own SQL code, but he knew that each extra table typically
    implies extra cost for development and maintenance.

    that the panelists expect are easily available. Don't spend five minutes showing
    a discussion forum, for example. Every panelist will have seen that. Show one
    page of the forum, explain that there is a forum, that there are several levels
    of moderator and privacy, and then move on to what is unique about what you've
    built. After one presentation, a panelist said "Everything that you showed is
    built into Microsoft Sharepoint". A venture capitalist on the panel chimed in
    "If at any time during a pitch someone points out that there is a Microsoft product
    that solves the same problem, the meeting is over."

    is by framing your achievement in terms of something that the audience is already
    familiar with, e.g., Yahoo! Groups or generic online community toolkits and then
    talk about what is different. You don't want the decision-maker to think to herself
    "Hey, I think I've seen this before in Microsoft Sharepoint" and have that thought
    in her head unaddressed the whole time.

- en: Decision-makers often bring senior engineers with them to attend presentations,
    and these folks can get stuck on personal leitmotifs. Suppose Joe Panelist chose
    to build his last project by generating XML from the database and then turning
    that into HTML via some expensive industry-leading middleware and XSLT, plus lots
    of Java and Enterprise Java Beans. This approach probably consumes 100 times more
    server resources than using Microsoft Visual Basic in Active Server Pages or a
    Perl script from 1993, but it is arguably cleaner and more modern. After a 12-minute
    presentation, no listener could have learned enough to say for sure that a project
    would have benefited from the XML/XSLT approach, but out he comes with the challenge.
    You could call him a pinhead because he doesn't know enough about your client
    and the original goals, e.g., not having to buy a 100-CPU server farm to support
    a small community. You could demonstrate that he is a pinhead by pointing out
    large and successful applications that use a similar architecture to what you've
    chosen. But as a junior engineer these probably aren't the best ways to handle
    unfair or incorrect criticism from a senior engineer at a meeting, especially
    if that person has been brought along by the decision-maker. It is much better
    to flatter this person by asking them to schedule a 30-minute meeting where you
    can really discuss the issue. Use that 30-minute meeting to show why you designed
    the thing the way that you did initially. You might turn the senior engineer around
    to your way of thinking. At the very least, you won't be arguing in front of the
    decision-maker or appearing to be arrogant/overconfident.

- en: The form's `method` can be either `GET` or `POST`. The only difference is that,
    with `method=GET`, the variables that the user submits are presented in the query
    string of the following page's URL. This is useful if you want the user to be
    able to bookmark the resulting page. However, if the user is expected to enter
    long strings of data, `method=POST` is more appropriate because some old browsers
    only handle query strings containing fewer than 256 characters (newer browsers
    can handle a few thousand). Note further that if you use the `GET` method, the
    form variable values will appear in the server access log and could create a security
    or privacy risk.
