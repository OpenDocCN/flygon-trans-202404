    languages is to provide specifications of the behavior of declared functions,
    so that program modules can be used without inspecting their code (*modular programming*).

- en: Let us now consider the use of comments in module *implementations*. The first
    question we must ask ourselves is who is going to read the comments written in
    module implementations. Because we are going to work hard to allow module users
    to program against the module while reading only its interface, clearly users
    are not the intended audience. Rather, the purpose of implementation comments
    is to explain the implementation to other implementers or maintainers of the module.
    This is done by writing comments that convince the reader that the implementation
    correctly implements its interface.

- en: It is inappropriate to copy the specifications of functions found in the module
    interface into the module implementation. Copying runs the risk of introducing
    inconsistency as the program evolves, because programmers don't keep the copies
    in sync. Copying code and specifications is a major source (if not *the* major
    source) of program bugs.  In any case, implementers can always look at the interface
    for the specification.

- en: Implementation comments fall into two categories. The first category arises
    because a module implementation may define new types and functions that are purely
    internal to the module. If their significance is not obvious, these types and
    functions should be documented in much the same style that we have suggested for
    documenting interfaces. Often, as the code is written, it becomes apparent that
    the new types and functions defined in the module form an internal data abstraction
    or at least a collection of functionality that makes sense as a module in its
    own right. This is a signal that the internal data abstraction might be moved
    to a separate module and manipulated only through its operations.

    We can also judge whether the rest of the program works without looking at the
    code of the function. However, we cannot reason locally about the individual functions
    in the three module implementations just given. The problem is that we don''t
    have enough information about the relationship between the concrete types (e.g.,
    `int list`, `bool vector`) and the corresponding abstract type (`set`). This lack

    we have to get to the same place. Suppose that we start from a concrete value
    and apply the actual implementation of some operation to it to obtain a new concrete
    value or values. When viewed abstractly, a concrete result should be an abstract
    value that is a possible result of applying the function *as described in its
    specification* to the abstract view of the actual inputs. For example, consider
    the union function from the implementation of sets as lists with repeated elements
    covered last time. When this function is applied to the concrete pair [1; 3],
    [2; 2], it corresponds to the lower-left corner of the diagram. The result of
    this operation is the list [2; 2; 1; 3], whose corresponding abstract value is
    the list {1, 2, 3}. Note that if we apply the abstraction function AF to the input
    lists [1; 3] and [2; 2], we have the sets {1, 3} and {2}. The commutative diagram

- en: When implementing a complex abstract data type, it is often helpful to write
    an internal function that can be used to check that the rep invariant holds of
    a given data item. By convention we will call this function `repOK`. If the module
    accepts values of the abstract type that are created outside the module, say by
    exposing the implementation of the type in the signature, then `repOK` should
    be applied to these to ensure the representation invariant is satisfied. In addition,
    if the implementation creates any new values of the abstract type, `repOK` can
    be applied to them as a sanity check. With this approach, bugs are caught early,
    and a bug in one function is less likely to create the appearance of a bug in
    another.

    input sets and to any set that is ever created. This ensures that if a bad set
    representation is created, it will be detected immediately. In case we somehow
    missed a check on creation, we also apply `repOK` to incoming set arguments. If
    there is a bug, these checks will help us quickly figure out where the rep invariant
    is being broken.

    of a program. The `repOK` above is quite expensive (though it could be implemented
    more cheaply). For production code, it may be more appropriate to use a version
    of `repOK` that only checks the parts of the rep invariant that are cheap to check.
    When there is a requirement that there be no run-time cost, `repOK` can be changed
    to an identity function (or macro) so the compiler optimizes away the calls to
    it. However, it is a good idea to keep around the full code of `repOK` (perhaps
    in a comment) so it can be easily reinstated during future debugging.

- en: Invariants on data are useful even when writing modules that are not easily
    considered to be providing abstract data types. Sometimes it is difficult to identify
    an abstract view of data that is provided by the module, and there may not be
    any abstract type at all. Invariants are important even without an abstraction
    function, because they document the legal states and representations that the
    code is expected to handle correctly. In general we refer to **module invariants**
    as invariants enforced by modules. In the case of an ADT, the rep invariant is
    a module invariant. Module invariants are useful for understanding how the code
    works, and also for maintenance, because the maintainer can avoid changes to the
    code that violate the module invariant.

    future changes to the module. We described interface specifications as a contract
    between the implementer of a module and the user. A module invariant is a contract
    among the various implementers of the module, present and future. Once an invariant
    is established, ADT operations may be implemented assuming that the rep invariant
    holds. If the rep invariant is ever weakened (made more permissive), some parts
    of the implementation may break. Thus, *one of the most important purposes of
    the rep invariant is to document exactly what may and what may not be safely changed
    about a module implementation*. A weak invariant forces the implementer to work
    harder to produce a correct implementation, because less can be assumed about
    concrete representation values, but conversely it gives maximum flexibility for
    future changes to the code.
